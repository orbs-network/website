That is, group participants can check, using verification keys, that a signature was indeed created by someone in the group but they cannot tell by whom. In case of disputes or misbehavior, a tracing authority uses its tracing key to trace back the signer.</p><p  class='text-p'>For some use cases having a single tracing authority works. However, in many other cases there is no single authority that everyone trusts for revoking anonymity and so it makes more sense to divide responsibility between several authorities. This insight lead Benjumea et al. to design “<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2008/047.pdf" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>Fair traceable multi-group signatures</em></a>”. In their scheme opening a signature is possible if multiple fairness authorities cooperate. The fairness authorities can also cooperate to reveal a tracing key of a user under suspicion. This key can be used to check if a message was signed by a certain user without revoking the anonymity of the other users.</p><p  class='text-p'>To this day, there are several signature schemes with distributed traceability that differ slightly regarding to the functionality they offer, such as “<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2008/112.pdf" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Democratic Group Signatures with Threshold Traceability</a>” by Zheng et al., and “<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/dfd3/0ee27ab7167900dbdddff11b22132f9ea5d5.pdf" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Short group Signatures with Distributed Traceability</a>” by Blomer et al., on which I will elaborate further.</p><h3 id="group-signatures-with-distributed-traceability-in-helix"  class='title-h3'
    >Group signatures with distributed traceability in Helix</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>At Orbs, we are developing <a href="https://www.orbs.com/helix-consensus-white-paper" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Helix</a>, our original consensus protocol which is especially designed for ensuring transactions are ordered in a fair way. The key concept in Helix is that network nodes cannot manipulate which transactions are included in a new block or their ordering. In particular they cannot censor specific nodes or users, and cannot favor their own transactions in a substantial way. You can read more about Helix in this blog <a href="https://medium.com/orbs-network/helix-the-orbs-consensus-algorithm-af5e6dc08856" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>post.</a></p><p  class='text-p'>A major contributor for fairness in Helix is having the users encrypt their transactions and then decrypt the original transactions only after they are appended to the blockchain. Encrypting the transactions comes at a price, in particular, it raises the need to punish users and nodes who are sending junk to the network instead of valid transactions. For this reason we need a mechanism for revealing which network nodes are responsible for problematic transactions in order to diminish their reputation.</p><p  class='text-p'>We can do this using group signatures with distributed traceability, by having each network node serve as a fairness authority and require a threshold number of authorities to open and trace signatures.</p><p  class='text-p'>I now turn to describing the flow a transaction makes in Helix and how group signatures with distributed traceability can be used. If you are less interested about this particular flow you can skip ahead and read about the candidate signature scheme. The flow starts when a user creates a transaction, encrypts it, and sends it to a network node that it is associated with. The network node then signs the transaction using a fair traceable group signature scheme and relays the transaction to the network. Before including the transaction in a block, the block creator checks the transaction has a valid group signature. After the block is appended to the blockchain, we initiate a process (which requires a threshold number of nodes) for decrypting the transactions in the block. If needed (for example, the decrypted transaction turns out to be invalid) a threshold number of nodes cooperate and open the signature in order to reveal which node signed this transaction.</p><p  class='text-p'>Another possible option for the flow is to open the signatures by default in parallel to the decryption process. The advantage of opening the signature by default is that this way we do not need to initiating a special protocol for faulty transactions and instead have this process executed as part of the normal flow. Another option is to incorporate the process of revealing a tracing key (used to trace a specific misbehaving node). We also note that some group signature schemes also have claim functionality, in which signers can claim the signature as belonging to them, which we did not use in the above flow.</p><p  class='text-p'>From our flow we deduce the <strong>security requirements</strong> we seek:</p><ul>
<li>Anonymity: A group signature does not reveal the identity of the member who produced it, unless more than a threshold number of fairness authorities cooperate.</li>
<li>Traceability maintains anonymity: If a node claims it is the originator of a signature or its identity was revealed as part of the tracing algorithm, this does not comprise the privacy of the remaining past or future group signatures that it issues.</li>
<li>Unlinkability: It is impossible to relate two or more signatures as being produced by the same signer without cooperation of a threshold number of authorities.</li>
<li>Non-frameability: Even if the group and tracing managers collude with the rest of the group, they cannot frame an honest group member. A user may be framed in two different ways: the authorities and other users may construct a signature that opens or traces to an innocent user (this requirement is also called strong exculpability), or they may claim a signature that was generated by the user as their own.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Other important requirements are: supporting dynamic change of signers and tracers, and not requiring trusted setup.</p><h3 id="-strong-candidate-signature-scheme-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>Candidate Signature Scheme</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>One of the most efficient signature scheme currently known is by Boneh, Boyen and Shacham (BBS), which they introduced in their paper “<a href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/groupsigs.pdf" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Short group signatures.</a>” Their signature scheme lacks a few properties required for our use. Firstly, their group signature scheme does not provide distributed traceability but rather requires a centralized tracing authority. In addition, their scheme does not satisfy “traceability maintains anonymity” property (because it does not provide CCA-anonymity, explained later on) which is crucial in our setting. Moreover, the key generation process requires a trusted dealer. Fortunately, there are follow-up papers that take care of the first two issues. The ideas can be combined to achieve a CCA-anonymous signature scheme that offers distributed traceability. Getting rid of the trusted dealer is an issue that needs to be addressed if we choose this scheme.</p><p  class='text-p'>In a paper by Blomer et. al, “Short group signatures with distributed traceability,” the scheme of BBS is extended to support distributed traceability. This is achieved in the following way. In the BBS scheme, part of the signature is an encryption of (part of) the secret key, and opening amounts to decrypting this ciphertext. In the paper by Blomer they change the encryption to threshold encryption. Opening a signature consists of two processes, the first is producing an open share from the signature, and the second is combining a threshold number of shares to decrypt back the signer’s key. Another modification they make is adding an additional element to the secret key which is only known to the user and not to the fairness authorities. This guarantees that fairness authorities cannot sign on behalf of other members.</p><p  class='text-p'>The scheme by BBS provides CPA-anonymity. Roughly, this means that the signatures are anonymous provided that the adversary does not get to query the trace signatures protocol. However, this assumption is not justified in our setting since an adversary may produce signed messages and send them to the blockchain, and afterwards they will be traced as part of our normal flow. Therefore, we require the signature scheme to be CCA-anonymous, which means that even an adversary which has access the open\tracing protocol, cannot trace the signature without cooperating with a threshold number of fairness authorities. In his paper, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11535218_10" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Communication-efficient non-interactive proofs of knowledge with online extractors</a>,” Fischlin introduces a method for transforming the signature scheme by BBS to be CCA-secure. This works by adding component to the signature which is generating a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of knowledge for the random values used when encrypting. Informally, this ensures that the adversary does not gain much from interacting with the tracing protocol since in order to sign a valid message she had to know the random values used for generating the encryption in the first place.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Size of the signature</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>The length of the BBS group signature scheme under the parameters suggested by the authors is 1,533 bits. This is comparable to the size of RSA signature, which is 1,024 or 2,048 bits long for signatures with similar security. Adding distributed traceability does not make the signature longer, but complexity wise it requires calculating lagrange polynomial interpolation in order to combine shares.</p><p  class='text-p'>As for the zero knowledge proof of knowledge , this is relatively large in size and is costly to compute. For the parameters suggested in the paper, the length of is 3,520 bits, which amounts to a signature length of 5,053 bits total.</p><p  class='text-p'>The size of the signature shares are 340 bits per share.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><em>I would like to thank Steven Goldfeder for helpful discussions on the subject.</em></p></div></div></div><div class="single-blog-bottom"><h3 class="single-blog-bottom-title">Get involved</h3><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex flex-between"><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/logo.svg" alt="orbs logo"/><h4>White papers</h4><a href="../white-papers" target="_blank">Read the Orbs white papers</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/github.svg" alt="github icon"/><h4>GitHub Repo</h4><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network" target="_blank">Review the code &amp; contribute</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/documents.svg" alt="document icon"/><h4>Documentation</h4><a href="../white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians" target="_blank">Developer documentation</a></div></div></div></main><div class="subscribe" style="display:none"><section class="subscribe-overlay"></section><form class="subscribe-form form"><button type="button" class="form-close-btn" aria-label="Close"><img src="../assets/img/common/close.svg" alt="close"/></button><h3 class="form-title">SUBSCRIBE FOR UPDATES</h3><div class="form-content flex-column"><div class="form-success" style="background:#191919"><p  class='text-p'>Amazing!

    >Potential Difficulties</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Naturally, deploying CBDCs involves certain difficulties, especially during the transition phase. Therefore, all relevant authorities and government agencies must be attentive and responsive in order to effectively mitigate issues as they present themselves.</p><p  class='text-p'>Among the potential difficulties we foresee, we expect the impact on the banking industry to be the most significant. As briefly described in prior witings, banks to some extent might experience a liquidity challenge affecting their available credit reserves, thus making credit more expensive through higher interest rates. There could be several paths to alleviate this and increase cash reserves:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Generating new lines of business - The banking industry could undergo a major shakeup as new blockchain-based platforms are deployed, and many traditional (and highly profitable) services will no longer be provided by banks. It will challenge banks to redefine their role in the new economy and to adapt accordingly. While some banks probably see this as a threat, others could use this as an opportunity to grab substantial market share as the demand for new financial services grows. From the general public&#39;s perspective and even the central bank&#39;s, this spur in competition is positive, forcing banks to become more efficient overall.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Central banks are in control of the deposit discount rate, and are therefore in control of the demand for CBDC and for banks&#39; cash reserves. Therefore, the likeliest scenario is one where the central bank will set an interest rate (on CBDC reserves) to reach a new, improved and stable equilibrium. That equilibrium will see only a limited portion of banks&#39; cash reserves flow to CBDC deposits, not most of it and certainly not all of it. As with other similar kinds of economic stabilization measures, it may take some time for the market to readjust, but the market will reach a new and better state, given that the central bank is trusted by the commercial banks</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The role of central banks is to balance several responsibilities in order to maintain a reliable, growing financial market. Providing the option of opening a CBDC account with the central bank makes any person or entity a de facto customer of the central bank. No one actually intends to have them deal directly with the general public, rather they would essentially outsource this service to commercial banks, generating a new line of business and new stream of revenues</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The new CBDC deposit accounts will not be credit facilities. Those will only be provided by commercial banks. Thus banks will focus on offering their customers active financial services rather than just money storage</p></li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>There may be additional difficulties involved in the process of migrating to CBDC, however we will only discuss two more: user privacy and raising sufficient public awareness.</p><p  class='text-p'>Firstly, privacy and anonymity, especially in the context of payment services, will always be a point of contention. On the one hand, many want full domain over their privacy by having the option to use fully anonymous means of payment. On the other hand, such features might be exploited by nefarious actors for illegal activity and tax evasion. As previously noted, CBDCs may provide different levels of user privacy, depending on the central bank&#39;s policy. The most simple solution would be leaving only the lowest value banknotes available, while limiting the allowed value per cash transaction. That would make the transition towards a true cashless economy smoother and quicker. In certain countries, it may even allow policy makers a defense against critics, as not all cash has been abolished.</p><p  class='text-p'>Secondly, getting the public on board may present difficulties. Public awareness campaigns and proper education should mitigate this. We truly believe that any argument that certain parts of the population could not handle this transition and might be victims for potential fraud are patently absurd. Yes, there will be fraudsters and it will take longer for some to &quot;master&quot; the use of digital payments. However, this genuine concern is not reason enough to reject change outright. Had that been the case, there would have been no move to e-banking, internet or mobile devices. Can you imagine our world today without any of them?</p><h3 id="suggested-strategic-outline"  class='title-h3'
    >Suggested Strategic Outline</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In light of the above, and assuming that we have been able to persuade the reader that CBDCs are a powerful instrument that ought to be adopted by central banks, we suggest the following strategy, which calls for a centralized CBDC on a private blockchain protocol but which allows for development into a decentralized protocol - if the technology proves itself to be viable. Deployment would occur in three steps according to this strategy, spread over several years, but starting sooner rather than later. There is no point in indicating the length of each phase, which would be an open question, but we certainly expect a central bank to set reasonable targets on this roadmap and stick to that plan.</p><ol>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 1 - Introducing CBDC Light, for digital payments only. This currency is the light version of the later full-featured centralized CBDC. The general public may open reserve accounts at the central bank, but they will not carry interest and are intended to be used as the central bank&#39;s certified digital wallets. The goal is to introduce the advantages of using digital payment services and reduce the use of cash to a minimum, leaving only the lowest value bills in circulation. This period will allow commercial banks to start getting used to the idea of having a CBDC, knowing that a full-featured CBDC is waiting just around the corner.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 2 - Introducing a full-featured centralized CBDC. Once the public and commercial banks are accustomed to this lighter CBDC, the central bank upgrades it to a full-featured implementation in order to maximize its merits and utilize it as a full monetary instrument. This period involves potential disruptions to the economy, as discussed above. It is up to the central bank to manage the process carefully in order to drive the economy towards its new equilibrium, in which commercial banks are more efficient and generate new revenue streams. In parallel, the central bank during this time closely examines blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets in order to determine when it would be suitable to deploy a decentralized CBDC</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 3 - Discussing decentralization. As noted earlier, we are still not convinced that CBDC decentralization is necessary or ever will be. Still, we urge central banks to think about it, even if just to push the envelope as a thought-experiment, so that as technology advances, they will be in a position to decide if implementation is the correct strategy for them. We are certain that with time, new technology would provide better solutions to problems that we now cannot see being resolved. Central banks should focus their efforts on understanding several key topics which are critical to a decentralized protocol:</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What is the desired level of user privacy and anonymity?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Who are the participating nodes?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>How does the White chain operate?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What are the KYC &amp; AML procedures for opening an account on that chain?</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion"  class='title-h3'
    >Conclusion</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In this series of posts, we have provided a brief overview of CBDCs and why they should be implemented sooner rather than later. Since CBDCs are such a powerful instrument, their implementation must be calculated and methodical in order to maximize their merits and minimize their demerits.</p><p  class='text-p'>The roles and importance of major actors in our global economy are constantly questioned as we head towards a &#39;new economy&#39;. Each and every one of them will have to adapt to technological innovation in order to maintain relevance and in their position of maintaining market stability. The same goes for central banks. Being the economy&#39;s equivalent of the &quot;responsible adults&quot; in the room, they must engage.</p><p  class='text-p'>We support the recent trend of central banks experimenting and considering issuing a CBDC. In our view, central banks that are looking to lead rather than be led, cannot ignore the potential benefits of this opportunity nor the pitfalls of failing to follow what seems like an inevitable culmination of digital economic innovation over the last two decades.</p></div></div></div></ul></div><div class="footer-tweets"><section class="footer-section-title"><img
