I don’t think this realization surprises anyone.</p><p  class='text-p'>What may be surprising to some is that apps are the ones in power in the blockchain infrastructure game. I just recently wrote a blog post about it — <a href="https://medium.com/orbs-network/who-controls-your-blockchain-5b8bf7ec7f1a" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Who Controls Your Blockchain?</a> — well, now more than ever it’s clear that apps do.</p><h4 id="the-stellar-fork-by-kin"  class='title-h4'
    >The Stellar fork by Kin</h4>
<p  class='text-p'><a href="https://kinecosystem.org/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Kin</a> by Kik Interactive is one of the first large-scale consumer apps to transition to blockchain . The main goal for Kin is to create a cryptocurrency (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kin/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>KIN</a>) to be used by millions of end users of digital services like Kik. Kin is a decentralized app that runs on top of a blockchain infrastructure.</p><p  class='text-p'>I’ve had the pleasure of working closely with Kin from its inception, leading blockchain engineering in Kin for the past seven months. Kin needs an immediate term blockchain solution in production in order to meet its business goals to become the mostly used cryptocurrency by consumers. To achieve this, due to the scalability limitations on Ethereum, Kin is launching its digital services ecosystem on the <a href="https://www.stellar.org/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Stellar blockchain</a> instead.</p><p  class='text-p'>So what’s the big news? It was recently announced by the Kin Foundation that this launch is not going to be on Stellar main net — it’s going to be on a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/chain-mobile-app-kik-fork-stellar-fee-free-blockchain/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Stellar fork</a>.</p><p  class='text-p'>Why would Kin do that? Forking a blockchain is difficult. Keeping a blockchain infrastructure in production is a massive undertaking. Securing value by yourself is a big risk and dealing with the scalability issues the consumer world brings is a task that emerging next generation infrastructure projects are just beginning to solve. So why defocus from just creating your app and decide to deal with this complexity yourself?</p><p  class='text-p'>It’s all a question of control. Taking your destiny into your own hands.</p><p  class='text-p'>The immediate reason is that Kin needs to scale quickly and Stellar fees are paid per wallet. If you plan to onboard as many users as possible, a fee model that grows directly with the number of users and is highly susceptible to churn and fraud works against your immediate interests. As stated by Kik’s CEO Ted Livingston:</p><p  class='text-p'><em>“While originally, the team had thought it could just subsidize the transaction fees, they soon realized that it would have to put lumens in people’s wallets to do that. As such, they theorized that bad actors could then just create a bunch of wallets and scrape up the lumens, in an effort to secure enough money to make an impact on the network.”</em></p><p  class='text-p'>The Stellar fork would allow Kin to change the fee model and avoid paying infrastructure fees to Stellar main net nodes altogether.</p><p  class='text-p'>If an app is unhappy with the model a blockchain infrastructure is providing, it will simply abandon it and move to another blockchain, or just fork it — like Kin has decided to do. This is a good example that eventually, the app is in control. And it will take its end-users wherever it goes.</p><h4 id="it-s-much-more-than-fees-it-s-about-governance"  class='title-h4'
    >It’s much more than fees — it’s about governance</h4>
<p  class='text-p'>Who controls how high or how low fees are on Stellar main net? This is a classic governance question as the fee model is a core part of the protocol. The Stellar validator nodes are the ones making this decision, they are free to choose whether fees are increased or reduced.</p><p  class='text-p'>In January, validators decided to decrease fees:</p><blockquote>
<p  class='text-p'>Quick Update | Validators on the <a href="https://twitter.com/StellarOrg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"title="link" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>@StellarOrg</a> network just voted to lower the base reserve to 0.5 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XLM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"title="link" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#XLM</a> which makes the cost of creating accounts and orders inexpensive again: <a href="https://t.co/2KqKu61aAY"title="link" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://t.co/2KqKu61aAY</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/blockchain?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"title="link" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#blockchain</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cryptocurrency?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"title="link" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#cryptocurrency</a> — Stellar (@StellarOrg) <a href="https://twitter.com/StellarOrg/status/951615519572021248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"title="link" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>January 12, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p  class='text-p'>What prevents the validators from voting on increasing fees tomorrow? Well, nothing theoretically. If higher fees work in their best interest, they are free to increase them to the detriment of the apps running on top.</p><h4 id="what-does-this-mean-for-blockchain-design-"  class='title-h4'
    >What does this mean for blockchain design?</h4>
<p  class='text-p'>Making protocol decisions that work against the interest of apps is likely to cause an adoption problem. If the fees you charge for infrastructure are too high — apps will find a cheaper alternative. If you create barriers of entry, like forcing apps to buy stake upfront and be locked-in to a specific project — apps will find an alternative that doesn’t have this lock-in. If the governance model you propose places a different group in control — apps will find an alternative where they’re not stripped of power.</p><p  class='text-p'>This understanding is one of the core principles upon which <a href="https://www.orbs.com/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs</a> is designed. The Orbs blockchain places apps in control and works together with these apps to make sure the protocol evolves according to their best interest, all while still enjoying the benefits of a completely decentralized environment.</p><p  class='text-p'>Governance on Orbs is performed using a permissionless federation where any app can join and take part in making protocol decisions. The model is built to strip power both from miners who have a hash power advantage over apps and from financial power groups who have more control over stake than apps. Infrastructure fees on Orbs are designed to be the lowest possible, pegged to the actual infrastructure cost. In addition to the use of a subscription model and monthly billing for transactions, this avoids the issue of fluctuating gas costs.</p><h4 id="how-do-blockchain-infrastructure-projects-avoid-forks-"  class='title-h4'
    >How do blockchain infrastructure projects avoid forks?</h4>
<p  class='text-p'>Some infrastructure projects create barriers to make forks difficult. A good example is <a href="https://www.hederahashgraph.com/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Hashgraph</a> where patents and intellectual property protections prevent users from forking the protocol. How will this strategy fair with apps? As long as apps will be able to find a parallel solution that provides roughly the same abilities, they are likely to prefer the solution without lock-in.</p><p  class='text-p'>Take a look at the Windows vs. Linux battle for servers and cloud computing. Initially, Microsoft Windows had a performance advantage due to the large corporate funding its development. Ultimately, it was only a matter of time until Linux caught up. The Linux permissive license, freedom of use, open source code base and lack of lock-in ultimately crowned it as the undisputed king of cloud computing.</p><p  class='text-p'>Another popular method of reducing the incentive to fork revolves around security. This is premise of many PoW networks like Bitcoin. The security of the network is directly related to the amount of hash power. Forking the project will not maintain the hash power of the original network, making the more popular fork significantly more secure.</p><p  class='text-p'>This method works well for use cases where Proof of Work is a good fit — store of value for example like Bitcoin. It seems that practically none of the next generation projects aimed for large scale consumer apps is based on PoW. It’s evident that there are other means of securing these networks that are easier to scale. EOS and Stellar, for example, are only running with a couple of dozen of nodes and presumably are secure enough without PoW. Forking these systems will not have a great impact on their degree of security.</p><p  class='text-p'>A different tactic for avoiding infrastructure forks by apps is creating lock-in with methods like placing the infrastructure token in the hands of end users. This is the case with Ethereum for example. For an end user to use an app over Ethereum, they must keep an Ether balance and pay the infrastructure fee directly. If an app wants to migrate away from Ethereum, it will have difficulty to do so because its user base now has a stake in Ether.</p><p  class='text-p'>Creating infrastructure lock-in for apps is a very dangerous approach. The best interest of a consumer app is maintaining its freedom of choice regarding infrastructure. If a better infrastructure solution pops up, the apps that will migrate to it will gain a competitive advantage over those who can’t. In addition, apps are likely to want their user base to adopt their own application token and not the infrastructure’s.</p><p  class='text-p'>Another incentive for avoiding forks is a thriving ecosystem. This is mostly relevant if you’re aiming for professional traders, investors and the secondary market. Take Ethereum’s ERC20 standard, for example. It’s well integrated in exchanges and wallets. Switching an app token to run over a solution that is less integrated in this space will have an impact on liquidity and professional trade.</p><p  class='text-p'>This also appears to make little difference with apps today. Kin has chosen to launch digital services on Stellar although Stellar has a significantly smaller integration ecosystem for secondary tokens. How did Kin avoid the impact on liquidity and professional trade? by running Ethereum and Stellar side by side. It is possible to allow different target audiences of the token (professionals vs. consumers in this case) to rely on different blockchain implementations according to their needs, and switch between implementations seamlessly with technologies like atomic swap. Professional traders aren’t the typcial end users of mass market consumer apps and their needs can be addressed by using Ethereum in parallel.</p><h4 id="so-what-s-the-best-way-to-avoid-forks-"  class='title-h4'
    >So what’s the best way to avoid forks?</h4>
<p  class='text-p'>Forking the infrastructure is always going to have a price. Owning the responsibility for maintaining a working blockchain infrastructure environment takes a toll. It requires focus and effort as this isn’t a small task. Security and scalability are issues that entire dedicated projects are focused on. Keeping up with the latest infrastructure technology advancements of this crazy space is even difficult for teams that were formed for this sole purpose. Apps will always have a hard time doing this in parallel to focusing on development of their app itself.</p><p  class='text-p'>Take a look at centralized infrastructure solutions — platforms like AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Why don’t centralized apps “fork” them and maintain their own infrastructure data centers? Well, they used to initially, but now it’s actually cheaper not to. An app will always prefer to focus on its core business as long as it doesn’t gain anything significant by doing something else. In the case of AWS for example, cloud providers have become so efficient that delegating the infrastructure task to them makes more business sense. Practically every modern centralized app today, Kik Messenger included, is running on third-party cloud infrastructure.</p><p  class='text-p'>This is exactly the approach we’re taking in Orbs. There is no benefit for apps in forking Orbs. The apps are already in control, they are the ones making governance decisions. They are isolated from one another with virtual chains. The fees are designed to be as low as possible and tied directly to the actual cost of infrastructure. There are no barriers of entry like buying stake upfront and there’s zero lock-in. Orbs is designed to be the most efficient infrastructure solution from an app standpoint, providing an inherent, intelligent sharding system through blockchain virtualization and <em>virtual chains</em>.</p><p  class='text-p'>Even better, there are actually great incentives not to fork. A specialized ecosystem of contributors maintaining the latest version of the protocol and keeping up with the latest infrastructure requirements — issues like privacy and aggressive sharding that next generation solutions are only starting to address.

    >The Need for Aggregated Liquidity</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>DEX-AMMs are the driving engine behind the DeFi revolution, as its most fundamental cornerstone. One of the most basic roles of any DEX is to provide its users with the best price possible when executing a trade. Better prices are obtained via better liquidity. However, on-chain liquidity is highly fragmented as it is spread across different chains, across different AMMs within the chain, and across different pools within the AMM.</p><p  class='text-p'>The problem of liquidity fragmentation in DeFi has become acute and directly impacts users via adverse exchange prices and material negative price impact on swaps.</p><p  class='text-p'>This problem contributed to the rise of liquidity aggregators such as <a href="https://1inch.io/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>1inch</a>, <a href="https://www.paraswap.io/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>ParaSwap</a>, <a href="https://swap.cow.fi/#/1/swap/WETH" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>CowSwap</a>, and others. While these aggregators do generally provide better prices as compared to any one individual DEX, thereby making it increasingly difficult for individual DEXs to compete, much of the value saving is routed into the aggregates&#39; pockets in the form of “positive slippage” and the users are not necessarily getting optimal prices.  </p><p  class='text-p'>While in the past, it seemed like most DEXs were focused on safeguarding their liquidity and volume within their own liquidity pool, it has now become ever more obvious that the future of DeFi lies with liquidity aggregation. A notable player who recently chose this path is <a href="https://uniswap.org/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Uniswap</a>, the largest DEX-AMM in existence. UniSwap recently announced <a href="https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswapx-protocol" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>UniswapX</a>, an aggregator interface outsourcing routing complexity to third-party fillers who complete swaps using on-chain third-party liquidity sources.       </p><p  class='text-p'>In light of the above, how can individual DEXs stay competitive in the age of aggregated liquidity?</p><p  class='text-p'>Introducing Liquidity Hub…</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Liquidity Hub by Orbs brings the power of aggregated liquidity to any DEX-AMM, enabling them to provide better price quotes to their users without jeopardizing their liquidity providers.</strong></p><h3 id="what-is-liquidity-hub-"  class='title-h3'
    >What is Liquidity Hub?</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub is an L3 infrastructure software that provides an optimization layer above the AMM, which taps external liquidity for better price quotes and lower price impact.</p><p  class='text-p'>Instead of the typical swap that searches for the best route within the DEX&#39;s limited liquidity pools, Liquidity Hub enhances this process by utilizing additional liquidity sources:</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>1) On-chain solver auction:</strong> Third-party solvers who compete to fill swaps using on-chain liquidity like AMM pools or their own private inventory.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>2) Decentralized orders via API:</strong> Decentralized orders, accessible using API. Enabling institutional/professional traders, such as market makers, to submit bids and compete to fill swaps.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/Liquidity-Hub-by-Orbs-The-New-Standard-for-DEXs/image1.png" alt="infographic"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub allows DEXs to attempt to execute trades without going through the AMM and experiencing AMM price impact. If the layer is unable to execute the trade at a better price than the AMM, the trade will fallback to the AMM contract and execute as usual.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, Liquidity Hub can only improve a trader’s experience. If Liquidity Hub isn’t competitive, meaning it would only execute at a worse price for the user or can’t execute at all, the swap will be routed through the AMM contract directly as usual.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/Liquidity-Hub-by-Orbs-The-New-Standard-for-DEXs/image2.png" alt="flow"></figure></p><h3 id="liquidity-hub-architecture-amp-product-spec"  class='title-h3'
    >Liquidity Hub Architecture &amp; Product Spec</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub is operated by a mix of an on-chain contract (deployed right next to the AMM contract) and backend logic (still running on-chain via Orbs decentralized L3 nodes). In any case, the Liquidity Hub on-chain contract protects end-users and ensures that their funds are safe and significant price manipulations cannot occur.</p><p  class='text-p'>Regular users attempting to swap don’t have to be aware that Liquidity Hub even exists. The Liquidity Hub contract guarantees that the execution price of the swap will be better than the execution price on the AMM contract. In other words, if Liquidity Hub isn’t competitive, it will be avoided. Since this guarantee is implemented at the contract level, there is no trust involved.</p><p  class='text-p'>Part of the Liquidity Hub logic is implemented off of the DEX’s underlying chain (off-chain risks can be mitigated using Orbs L3 as further described below). Since the data structure is held off-chain, adding and removing orders from the Liquidity Hub will take a few milliseconds (without waiting for a new block to be closed) and will not cost gas. All of these properties are attractive for market makers because they are on par with CEXs.</p><p  class='text-p'>All funds are held on-chain in a non-custodial manner. Participants that place an order in Liquidity Hub keep their funds in their own wallet. The Liquidity Hub contract will be approved to initiate the transaction that sends the funds from the account on match. Verification of orders will always take place on-chain through the Liquidity Hub contract. The contract will verify that the execution upholds both sides’ requirements and that the execution price is better than the AMM. On match, the funds will be exchanged between the parties directly on-chain.</p><p  class='text-p'>Below are the key product spec of Liquidity Hub:</p><ul>
<li>No change in the DEX UI for users.</li>
<li>API for solvers + decentralized order interface for MMs Nominal to zero latency execution for users.</li>
<li>Token spending approval by users on MetaMask.</li>
<li>Funds remain in the user wallet until trades execute.</li>
<li>Liquidity Hub trades are gasless for users (although solvers may price gas into their fees)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="liquidity-hub-main-features"  class='title-h3'
    >Liquidity Hub Main Features</h3>
<p  class='text-p'><strong>Avoiding LP Cannibalization</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>One of the primary requirements of Liquidity Hub is to avoid cannibalizing the existing AMM business. </p><p  class='text-p'>This means that existing LPs need to generate the same revenue with Liquidity Hub enabled as they would have generated without it.</p><p  class='text-p'>How is this achieved?</p><p  class='text-p'>The graph below analyzes the performance of Quickswap trades using Dune Analytics. The x-axis is the price impact (percent) suffered per trade. The y-axis is the volume. The graph is calculated over all trades over a long period of time. We’ve executed similar queries on UniSwap and Pancakeswap, and the numbers are actually almost identical.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/Liquidity-Hub-by-Orbs-The-New-Standard-for-DEXs/image3.png" alt="graph"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>The first thing we see in the graph is that price impact has two sides. Negative price impact is where users swap tokens for prices that are worse than market price. These are usually retail users. Positive price impact is where users swap tokens for prices that are better than market price. These are usually institutional arbitrageurs. An AMM is a zero sum game, for every trade with a negative price impact there’s a parallel trade with a positive one.</p><p  class='text-p'>Arbitrageurs have to compete on the positive price impact trades since those are profitable. Ordering the transactions takes place by chain validators, so they are essentially sharing a percentage of the profit with them (via MEV, gas bids, etc). </p><p  class='text-p'>Since Liquidity Hub trades have priority over AMM trades (assuming price for users is similar) and it does not rely on the chain validators for its ordering, Liquidity Hub’s function is effectively to remove these MEV losses and re-distribute them among users, LPs and solvers. In addition, Liquidity Hub’s trades don’t generate any impermanent loss for LPs, which is an improvement over AMM trades.</p><p  class='text-p'>In this way, the DEX keeps its ability to incentivize LPs to keep providing liquidity on its platform.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Cutting Out the Middleman</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub provides MEV protection.</p><p  class='text-p'>As explained above, arbitrage loss to MEV can be significant. Since Liquidity Hub matches orders off-chain (without block producers), it removes MEV losses. These savings are then re-distributed between the users and the DEX itself. This ratio can be set by the platform to best suit its needs.</p><p  class='text-p'>The distribution mechanism is a key differentiator between Liquidity Hub and other protocols such as UniSwapX.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Fully Composable Solution for Solvers</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub is a fully composable DeFi protocol building block.</p><p  class='text-p'>UniSwapX is emerging as a standard for solvers. Liquidity Hub supports UniSwapX and other similar protocols solver (or filler) API, enabling anyone to participate in the bidding process. This feature means that Liquidity Hub can connect to multiple solvers right out of the box. The DEX has the option to pre-approve solvers if it wishes to.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Fully Supports CeFi Market Makers</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub software will allow DEXs to support standard CEX book API allowing traditional MM to participate in DeFi.</p><p  class='text-p'>After having some detailed discussions with industry-leading market makers, we noticed that this class of participants is ill suited for on-chain AMM activity. The core of their business takes place on CEXs and their core expertise is book building. This expertise doesn’t come across on AMMs. Issues like gas costs for unfulfilled orders, inability to cancel orders immediately or simply lack of an order book prevent many market makers from participating in DeFi as much as they would like to.</p><p  class='text-p'>Market makers are one of the primary sources of liquidity in the industry, and the ability for a DEX to bring them into DeFi is a significant advantage. The Liquidity Hub model solves most of the issues that prevent many market makers from participating in DEXs today and opens the gate for market makers to profit from trading on such platforms.</p><p  class='text-p'>This is another key differentiator between Liquidity Hub and UniSwapX, which does not support an order book.</p><h3 id="mitigating-centralization-risks-in-liquidity-hub-using-orbs-l3"  class='title-h3'
    >Mitigating Centralization risks in Liquidity Hub using Orbs L3</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>All on-chain parts are trustless since contracts verify all actions. However, one may be concerned that the off-chain Liquidity Hub backend is able to manipulate trades in some way. This is avoided by using Orbs’ decentralized L3 technology.</p><p  class='text-p'>The <a href="https://orbs.com" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs Network</a> is an open, decentralized and public blockchain infrastructure executed by a secure network of permissionless validators (known as “Guardians”) using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. Orbs is optimized to provide “L3” services, working in conjunction with existing L1 and L2 layers and acting as a “decentralized backend” that enhances the capabilities of EVM smart contracts. Orbs Network mainnet is live since 2019 and has dozens of <a href="https://status.orbs.network/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>active validators</a> staked with <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x01d59af68e2dcb44e04c50e05f62e7043f2656c3" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>over $100M</a>.</p><p  class='text-p'>The network provides its <a href="https://www.orbs.com/execution-services/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>L3 services</a> by operating as a decentralized serverless cloud that allows developers to design applications that extend the capabilities of their smart contracts without relying on traditional centralized server solutions. These applications are deployed to be executed by the Orbs Guardians in a decentralized way.</p><p  class='text-p'>Orbs’ L3 offering is divided into two categories - ORBS-VM and ORBS-Lambda. ORBS-VM is a docker-compatible decentralized virtual machine, similar in concept to AWS EC2. This is designed for more complicated functions. </p><p  class='text-p'>For simpler functions, Orbs Network offers ORBS-Lambda - a decentralized and serverless cloud function solution, similar to AWS-Lambda. Developers can write cloud functions and, when the specified trigger occurs, Orbs Guardians then execute the function on the specified L1 blockchain in a decentralized way. </p><p  class='text-p'>As part of Liquidity Hub, Orbs Guardians will run software utilizing <a href="https://docs.orbs.network/v3/orbs-vm/what-is-orbs-vm" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>ORBS-VM</a> that acts as a decentralized backend that is required for Liquidity Hub’s off-chain portion to run optimally and in a fully decentralized manner. </p><h3 id="summary-liquidity-hub-the-next-evolution-of-dex-amms"  class='title-h3'
    >Summary: Liquidity Hub - the Next Evolution of DEX-AMMs</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub brings the benefit of aggregated liquidity to any DEX-AMM in DeFi.</p><p  class='text-p'>The protocol presents significant benefits to all stakeholders:</p><ul>
<li>DEX <strong>users</strong> enjoy first and foremost better execution prices, as well as other benefits such as MEV protection. As we recall, Liquidity Hub guarantees that the final execution price of a completed transaction is always better than the AMM, all fees included. Users can only save money by using Liquidity Hub.</li>
<li>The <strong>DEX</strong> platform itself can now enjoy added liquidity and increased volumes without cannibalizing its own LP. In addition, the fee mechanism can bring additional fee revenue for the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Solvers</strong>, who are emerging as a key function in DeFi can integrate into Liquidity Hub to expand their services. Moreover, Liquidity Hub has the potential to on-board professional market makers into the space, taking DeFi to the next level.</li>
