The contractRegistry manages the PoS contracts list and active managers. The contract is the basis of the system and allows any contract or user to retrieve the up-to-date contract lists. The contractRegistry pushes contract address updates to the PoS managed contracts. The contract registry is the core component of the PoS contracts upgrade and allows to transition to a new contract for each contract in the system, as well as the registry itself.
