The [staking contact](https://etherscan.io/address/0x01d59af68e2dcb44e04c50e05f62e7043f2656c3#readContract) holds the participants staked tokens. The staking contract notifies the stakingContractHandler upon any change in a participant stake, for example upon a stake or unstake actions. See: Orbs Staking Contract High-Level Specification
