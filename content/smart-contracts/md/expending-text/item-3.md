The staking contract handler connects the staking contract to the Orbs PoS contracts and to Orbsâ€™ contracts governance, managed by the contractRegistry. The stakingContractHandler provides an infrastructure for connecting an additional staking contract or isolating the staking contract actions from the rest of the PoS contracts if needed.
