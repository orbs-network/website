The contract architecture is based on 2 levels: global allocation, committee Guardians. The feesAndBootstrapRewards collects fees from two instances of fees wallets the certificated and general virtual chains fees.
The protocol wallets are disconnected from the PoS contracts governance and management infrastructure and are managed by two types of administrators: a functional administrator that sets the walletâ€™s client and a migration administrator that controls the withdrawal of funds.
