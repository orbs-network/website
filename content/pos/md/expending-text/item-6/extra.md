Below is a list of the the key improvements in terms of efficiency and cost reduction:

- Operation cost is significantly reduced.
- For AWS-deployed nodes: a base infrastructure monthly cost reduction, with options to reduce the cost further by reserving resources in advance.
- An elastic architecture that leverages cloud architectures and enables compute and storage resources allocation as needed for the network use.
- Transition to EFS/NFS-based block storage architecture, significantly reducing the storage cost and providing more flexible resource sharing among Virtual Chains, while maintaining the Virtual Chains isolation.
- Utilizing light Ethereum client architecture to reduce the cost of the Ethereum service operation.
- Automatic and simple node setup, with enhanced logging and monitoring tools for reduced operations overhead.
