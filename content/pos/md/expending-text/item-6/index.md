Orbs PoS Universe V2.5 significantly reduced the cost of operating and maintaining a validator node on the Orbs Network. This, combined with the development of new automation tools for Guardians, will decrease the operation costs of existing Guardians, as well as lower the barrier to entry of new Guardians into the Orbs Universe, thereby improving the level of the Orbs networkâ€™s decentralization.
