##### Roles and Responsibilities

- Actively contribute to the network’s success by staking your ORBS tokens. [Instructions](https://www.orbs.com/tetra-orbs-staking-wallet-tutorial/) on how to stake using the Orbs Tetra wallet.
- Select a worthy [Guardian](https://staking.orbs.network/?p=/guardians) to delegate your voting power to.
- Staked tokens will be locked for a period of 14 days. Read more about the [Orbs locking](https://www.orbs.com/introducing-locking-when-staking-orbs) mechanism.
- Orbs Delegators can choose to stake on Ethereum or Polygon.

##### Economic Incentives

- Token holders that delegate to an active Guardian are rewarded in proportion to their stake.
- Annual reward of up to 6.66% of the Delegator’s staked tokens, depending on the reward distribution split set by the selected Guardian.
- Only delegation to an active Guardian that participates in the elected committee receives rewards. Also, it is important to note that staking rewards may vary between Guardians, so choose your Guardian carefully!
