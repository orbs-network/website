##### Roles and Responsibilities

- Guardians operate the Orbs network validator nodes and run the subscribed applications.
- Guardians are responsible for the staking rewards distribution to their community of delegators by being able to modify their Delegator’s rewards split.
- Guardians have an option to be part of the [Certified Committee](https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians-section-election-committees) and operate virtual chains that require certified Guardians. Certified Committee members are eligible for added incentives.
- Guardians are expected to be committed to their communities and their Delegators’ staked tokens. Following [OGV-1&2 ](https://www.orbs.com/Reinstating-Guardians-Self-Stake-Requirement/), Guardians are required to have a self-stake of at least 3% of their total delegated stake.

##### Economic Incentives

- Guardians receive staking rewards of at least 3.33% of their delegated stake, for operating the network and contributing to the network’s security.
- Guardians who choose to participate in the Certified Committee receive a bootstrap fund distributed in DAI.
