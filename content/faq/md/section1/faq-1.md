Orbs offers the winning blockchain stack, providing the perfect mix of performance, cost, security and ease of use, while harnessing the power of community, decentralization and distribution.

Orbs is a public blockchain infrastructure designed for mass usage applications and close integration with EVM-based L1’s such as Ethereum and Binance SmartChain. Unlike private and permissioned blockchain solutions typically used for such applications, the Orbs infrastructure is open and permissionless. The Orbs protocol is decentralized and executed by a public network of permissionless validators using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. The Orbs protocol relies on the ORBS token used for the settlement of fees related to app execution and provides the system of incentives used to elect validators (who are referred to as “Guardians”) in a secure and decentralized manner.

Founded in 2017, Orbs is being developed by a dedicated team of more than 30 people out of Tel Aviv, Israel, London, UK, Singapore, Tokyo, Japan and Seoul, South Korea. Orbs was named Gartner’s “Cool Vendor in Blockchain Technology” for 2018.
