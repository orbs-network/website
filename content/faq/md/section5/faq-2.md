Currently, most enterprises do choose to use private blockchain solutions. This is true today but we believe that this trend will eventually change since the disruption in blockchain technology comes from the open and permissionless (public) aspect. A good comparison is the Internet. When the Internet was first introduced a few decades ago, most corporations were very hesitant to connect to it. Common fears were - “I don’t want to make all of my data public. I don’t want to be hacked.” Today it is common knowledge that connecting a corporation to the Internet does not automatically make all of their data public. Furthermore, every corporation is connected to the Internet and this public connectivity is crucial for doing business. We believe that public blockchain will behave the same way. Many corporations will connect to it, and will eventually realize that they have full control as to what data is available there.
