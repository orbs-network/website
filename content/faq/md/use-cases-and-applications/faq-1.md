dTWAP (decentralized time-weight  average price) is a decentralized protocol powered by Orbs for DEXs.

dTWAP is an algorithmic trading order that divides a trading order into a number of smaller trades and executes these trades at regular intervals over a specified period of time.

dTWAP enables DEX users to execute more sophisticated trading orders such as price impact reduction and DCA (dollar cost averaging).
