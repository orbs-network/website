The fees and rewards in the Orbs Proof-of-Stake architecture serve two important purposes. The first is compensation for operating a validator node. The second is a reward for contributing to network security by staking.

Staking rewards are awarded for the stake that Guardians and Delegators allocate to contribute to the networkâ€™s security. A maximum annual reward equal to 12% of total delegated stake is awarded, subject to an 80M Orbs Token cap, addressing the tradeoff between an appealing incentive and sustainable inflation.
