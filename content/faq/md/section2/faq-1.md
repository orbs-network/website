The Orbs PoS Universe is the backbone of the Orbs network and the Universe that is being created. Orbs’ current PoS model - “Orbs Universe V2.5: The Age of Guardians”, empowers the Orbs Universe Guardians to take an active role in building and maintaining a secure, scalable network, that will be the first choice for blockchain adoption. In V2.5, the POS ecosystem is centered around two core roles – Guardians and Delegators.
