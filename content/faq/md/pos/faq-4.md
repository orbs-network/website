Yes, Orbs PoS has a locking period of 14 days to assure that participants in the PoS ecosystem are committed to the network and maintain its security. Delegators are not expected to unstake their tokens until they decide to leave the PoS ecosystem and transfer them to another use or an exchange. If a delegator does decide to leave, only then there will be a 14 days cooldown during which the tokens are not staked anymore and do not receive rewards. This is similar to other leading PoS systems such as Cosmos or PolkaDot.

Here is a comprehensive paper on the Orbs PoS [locking mechanism.](https://www.orbs.com/introducing-locking-when-staking-orbs/)
