On January 11, Orbs and Binance exchange [announced](https://www.binance.org/en/blog/orbs-and-binance-team-up-to-launch-defi-accelerator/) that they are teaming up to promote innovation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space by serving as the first core sponsors of the [DeFi.org](https://defi.org/) accelerator, which bootstraps new projects and DeFi protocols.

The [DeFi.org Accelerator](https://www.defi.org/) is dedicated to supporting research, development of open-source software, and community engagement. The accelerator looks for projects that are built on the principles of fair distribution, community ownership, innovation, responsible approach to risk, sustainable economics and composability with the broader ecosystem
