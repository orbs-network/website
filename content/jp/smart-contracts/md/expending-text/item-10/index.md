The fees wallets maintain the subscription fees paid by virtual chains. Two separate instances of fees wallets are deployed one for general virtual chains fees and one for certified virtual chains fees. The fees wallets store the subscription fees in 30 days buckets, to provide an accurate division of the fees for each time period.
