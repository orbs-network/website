The [GuardiansRegistration](https://etherscan.io/0xce97f8c79228c53b8b9ad86800a493d1e7e5d1e3) contract stores the Guardians registration data. And allow Guardians to register, modify their data and unregister. In addition the contact stores a metadata map allowing each Guardian to store general purpose keys to be queried by the Orbs platform. For example, a link to the Guardian identification data may be stored at the "ID_FORM_URL" metadata key.
