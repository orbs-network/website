The [stakingRewardsWallet](https://etherscan.io/0xdBb374E965B21C5d6EE370dcB80176884Fa936f1) and [bootstrapRewardsWallet](https://etherscan.io/0x60f99fe905c714a1eb1d50e7dfb91c9f956478e0) hold the protocol fund allowing the relevant rewards contract to withdraw funds up to the maximal rate that was set. The protocol wallets provide a simple, and thus secure, mechanism to store the protocol funds.
