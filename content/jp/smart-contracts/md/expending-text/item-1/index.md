The [contractRegistry](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD859701C81119aB12A1e62AF6270aD2AE05c7AB3) manages the PoS contracts list and active managers. The contract is the basis of the system and allows any contract or user to retrieve the up-to-date contract lists. The contractRegistry pushes contract address updates to the PoS managed contracts.
