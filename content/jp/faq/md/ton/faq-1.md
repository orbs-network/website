Since its inception in 2017, the mission of Orbs Network has been to empower developers to build better protocols and products without sacrificing decentralization or their ability to reach mass audiences.

When operating as L3, Orbs is naturally augmenting an existing base L1 blockchain layer and builds on top of it. TON is the infrastructure for apps targeting the masses. Much like Telegram, it is mobile first, consumer oriented and built for the Internet scale of billions. If blockchain ever reaches the masses, it will likely be via TON, which is why Orbs strives to become a major player and stakeholder in the TON ecosystem
