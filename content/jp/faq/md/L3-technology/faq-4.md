Orbs offers 2 main [executing services](https://inquisitive-brigadeiros-d00a52.netlify.app/execution-services/): Orbs VM and Orbs Lambda.

Orbs VM is a dedicated and decentralized virtual machine, similar in concept to [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) - only decentralized.

Orbs VM services are implemented as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers, deployed to the Orbs Network and then executed by the network validators. Much like AWS EC2 container services, there is minimal DevOps involved as orchestration is automated. Unlike AWS EC2, the protocol is fully transparent and decentralized, providing execution guaranteed to the user community by relying on dozens of independent network validators that participate in the protocol.
