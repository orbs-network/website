The current blockchain stack consists of 2 main layers:
The first infrastructure layer, L1 (like Ethereum), is in charge of security. The second infrastructure layer, L2 (like Polygon), is in charge of scalability.

Orbs is based on the vision of a third infrastructure layer, L3, which is in charge of executing complex logic and scripts that cannot be implemented on smart contracts alone. This layer provides services to existing DeFi applications for further decentralization and enhanced capabilities.
