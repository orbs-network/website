Orbs offers 2 main [executing services:](/execution-services) Orbs VM and Orbs Lambda.

Orbs Lambda is an event driven, serverless and decentralized cloud function, similar in concept to AWS Lambda - only decentralized.

Cloud functions are implemented in a few lines of code, deployed to the Orbs Network and then executed by the network validators. Much like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), there is no DevOps involved and no instances to worry about. Unlike AWS Lambda, the protocol is fully transparent and decentralized, providing execution guaranteed to the user community by relying on dozens of independent network validators that participate in the protocol.
