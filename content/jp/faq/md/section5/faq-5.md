Yes!

The ORBS token is now available on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and can be swapped from the Ethereum mainnet to the BSC mainnet and back. This integration is a result of work done by multichain.xyz utilizing the [cross-chain bridge](orbs-is-now-live-on-binance-smart-chain-via-anyswap-cross-chain-bridge) infrastructure they have developed.

The ORBS token is also [available](orbs-is-now-live-on-pancakeswap) on PancakeSwap, one of the most popular DEX/AMM on BSC. The Orbs team is working on expanding the Orbs integration into BSC.
