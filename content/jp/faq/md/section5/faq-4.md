As a decentralized project, Orbs understands the power in community contributions and is always looking for ways to further expand the number of contributors developing the network and ecosystem.

In August 2020, the [Orbs team announced the Orbs Ecosystem Grant Program (OEGP)](white-papers/orbs-grant-program), which is intended to involve even more developers and teams in the development of the Orbs ecosystem.
Any team or individual can submit a proposal to receive a grant for DeFi projects that may integrate with Orbs ecosystem. Such projects include among others: Liquidity pools, collateral-backed loans, oracles, and more. Once submitted, the Orbs team will evaluate the proposal and approved applications will have the means to carry out their project in collaboration with the Orbs team.
