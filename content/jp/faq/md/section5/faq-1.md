Applications running on public blockchain are unique in their ability to facilitate trust by providing blockchain-backed guarantees to their users. Whereas many popular public blockchain solutions like Ethereum are designed primarily for purely decentralized applications (dapps), Orbs expands the offerings of public blockchains by also supporting permissioned applications developed by existing for-profit businesses.

The Orbs networkâ€™s novel architecture solves multiple costs issues that are often associated with public blockchains, namely the [diseconomy of scale:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YfLxDcCHc8) costs increase with demand, unpredictable fees, unknown SLA, and more.
This gives the Orbs network a great advantage when competing with other blockchain infrastructure projects for enterprise use-cases in terms of cost model for apps.
