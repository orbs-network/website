Orbs is an ERC20 token but has its own mainnet.

Orbs is designed as a hybrid blockchain, maintaining both an independent blockchain and PoS architecture, as well as utilizing the Ethereum network as an [external objective blockchain](https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/use-of-ethereum-as-a-base-layer-for-pos-and-poa-platforms/) for the PoS logic. ORBS token, staking, delegation and voting operate over Ethereum contracts. This PoS over Ethereum architecture provides multiple advantages, including a high level of transparency, ease of subscription payments and staking, additional security and ensuring the [integrity of elections.](https://www.orbs.com/pos-external-oversight/)

Recently, Orbs has also added PoS staking on Polygon as part of its Orbs PoS V3: Multichain staking [protocol upgrade.](https://www.orbs.com/polygon-staking/)
