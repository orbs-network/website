Orbs PoS V3 [adjusts](https://www.orbs.com/PolygonStakingDate/) the staking rewards to a fixed 10% APR of the Delegators staked ORBS tokens.

Depending on each Guardian's setting, staking rewards are split between the Guardian and his Delegator. Currently, all Guardians are choosing the default setting (⅓ for guardian, ⅔ for Delegator) making the final reward rate for delegators is 6.67% and 10% for guardians.
