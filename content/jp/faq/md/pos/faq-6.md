In order to participate in the Orbs universe, token holders are required to stake their tokens and select a Guardian to delegate their voting power to. Orbs Guardians represent the Orbs community; they maintain the security of the network and uphold its long-term vision. Therefore, it is important for Orbs Delegators to choose a trustworthy and active Guardian and monitor their performance.

Delegators should note that Guardians are entitled to change the [rewards ratio](https://www.orbs.com/how-to-choose-an-orbs-guardian/) to their Delegators within the allowed range of 66.667% to 0%. Therefore, it is important to note that staking rewards may vary between Guardians, so choose your Guardian carefully!

The full Guardians list for staking on Ethereum and Polygon can be seen in the [Tetra](https://staking.orbs.network/#/) staking wallet.
