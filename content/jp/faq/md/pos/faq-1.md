Orbs PoS V3: Multi-chain staking, [utilizes](https://www.orbs.com/Polygon-tech/) Orbs hybrid architecture and cross-chain properties to deploy a novel multi-chain PoS staking on both Ethereum and Polygon.

Adding Orbs PoS staking on Polygon means that the Orbs network utilizes the Ethereum stack to its fullest potential: The security of Ethereum as the base layer, and the scalability & low fees of Polygon as L2.

In this way, Orbs PoS V3 addresses one of the key feedbacks from the community and is expected to mitigate the problem of Ethereumâ€™s gas spikes leading to high costs for Orbs delegators interacting with the Orbs staking contracts.
