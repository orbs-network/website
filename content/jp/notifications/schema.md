Notification schemas are constantly executed by protocol alert nodes in order to analyze new blocks of on-chain data for notifying protocol subscribers. Alert nodes are running on Orbs Network, a permissionless and decentralized oracle chain, and executed by the public validators of the network. Orbs Network has dozens of independent validators running Proof-of-Stake consensus with over $100 million staked. The network has been running in mainnet since 2019.
