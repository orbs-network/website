title: Automation of Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

DCA is an investing strategy that purchases an asset on a recurring long-term schedule (ie. on every Monday). 

The goal behind DCA is to average out abnormal market conditions and lessen the impact of short-term volatility on the overall purchase. A TWAP strategy can fully automate the DCA process.
