title: Evolution of Decentralized Execution
---

The first decentralized execution platform in the world that was truly Turing-complete is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM was a marvel of innovation, but for security considerations as a base layer, had to limit its execution capabilities in a tight security sandbox.

Orbs Lambda expands these capabilities significantly by allowing developers to use the world's most popular language - JavaScript - without limits and fully access data outside the chain.
Orbs VM takes execution capabilities a step further and allows developers to use any programming language over the world's most popular container - Docker.
