Orbs smart contracts provide seamless cross-chain access to Ethereum state under consensus, thus allowing applications to read the Ethereum state directly using the above mechanism. This allows applications running on Orbs to leverage the power of Ethereum directly without leaving the platform. An example of this technology is autonomous swap, a secure mechanism that allows developers to move part of the base-layer assets (ex: ERC-20 tokens) to run on Orbs for their utility while keeping other parts on the base-layer for trade.
