As with any smart contract, there are certain associated risks.

However, the protocol has undergone extensive auditing by [PeckShield](https://github.com/orbs-network/twap/blob/master/Audit-Report-PeckShield.pdf) and [RDAuditors](https://github.com/orbs-network/twap/blob/master/Audit-Report-RDAuditors.pdf). In addition it should be noted that the protocol’s [smart contract](https://github.com/orbs-network/twap) does not hold any funds, has no owners, administrators or other roles and is entirely immutable once deployed on an EVM blockchain.

Lastly, the protocol has been in production since the beginning of 2023 and integrated by multiple leading DEXs (such as QuickSwap, SpookySwap, and more…), processing tens of millions of dollars in trading volume to date.
