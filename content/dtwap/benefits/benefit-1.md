title: Price Impact Reduction
---


When a trade is relatively large or involves a low-liquidity pair, price impact will be high and cause significant losses to traders.

TWAP eliminates price impact by spreading the trade over several minutes. This gives arbitrageurs a time window to close price discrepancies and bring the reserves back to the fair market spot price.
