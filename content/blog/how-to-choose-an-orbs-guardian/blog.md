Orbs PoS V2.5: The Age of Guardians, has introduced many new features into the Orbs PoS Universe. A key component of which is empowering the Orbs Guardians to take a more active role in building and maintaining a secure, scalable network, which will be the first choice for blockchain adoption.

These added responsibilities of the Orbs Guardians make it extra-important for Delegators to properly choose a Guardian, who will look after the network and his Delegator’s best interests.

As a result, we thought it’d be a good idea to provide this short guide on how to best choose an Orbs Guardian. With these easy steps, Delegators will be able to ensure that they are staking their ORBS tokens in a way that actively contributes to the success of the Orbs network.

### Orbs Delegators roles & responsibilities

Delegators are ORBS token holders who assign their voting weight (stake) to Guardians, thereby empowering them to maintain the security of the Network and uphold the long term vision of the ecosystem.

Token holders that delegate to an active Guardian are rewarded in proportion to their stake. Only delegation to an active Guardian that is in the committee and operates a validator node receives rewards. A Guardian that does not fulfill its responsibilities can harm the network and will cause its Delegators to lose their rewards. Therefore, it is imperative for Delegators to monitor their Guardians and make sure that they are fulfilling their responsibilities.
