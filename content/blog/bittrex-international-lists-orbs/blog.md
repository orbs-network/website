# Bittrex International Lists Orbs Token (ORBS) Following Project’s Production Launch

### _Production ready environment, built entirely from new code, is the first to leverage requirement driven approach to enable real business value on the blockchain_

Orbs, the hybrid blockchain, announced today that the Orbs token (ORBS) has been listed on Bittrex International.

The listing follows the release of the project’s enterprise-grade public blockchain in late March. The project is the first blockchain to address fundamental issues of performance and interoperability alongside the needs for true decentralization.

“Following the launch of our production ready environment, we are excited to take this next step in bringing the project forward,” said Daniel Peled, Orbs President and Co-Founder. “Partnering with Bittrex International will help us better bring developers and businesses the support and product to fulfill the potential of the technology.”
