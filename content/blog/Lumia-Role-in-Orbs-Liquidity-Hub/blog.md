The Orbs Liquidity Hub has taken another step in optimizing decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity by integrating Lumia, a next-generation hyper-liquid zkEVM solution designed to enhance trade execution and liquidity aggregation. As the DeFi space evolves, fragmented liquidity across multiple chains remains a significant challenge, leading to inefficiencies like slippage and higher costs for traders. Lumia will join the growing number of solvers contributing to the Liquidity Hub by Orbs, a novel product combating these inefficiencies with cutting-edge technology.

Lumia’s integration adds to a powerful on-chain solver auction system, where solvers compete to fulfill trade orders by drawing liquidity from diverse sources, including AMM pools, cross-chain, and off-chain reserves. This dynamic ensures that trades are executed at better prices, surpassing traditional DEX-AMM models. By doing so, Orbs Liquidity Hub further strengthens its ability to enable DEXs to aggregate liquidity from anywhere, delivering optimal pricing without manual liquidity sourcing.

### How Liquidity Hub Works

Liquidity Hub is an Orbs [layer 3 (L3)](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-layer-3s-crypto) powered meta aggregator that provides an optimization layer above the AMM. This technology taps external liquidity for better price quotes and lower price impact.

Instead of the typical swap that searches for the best route within the DEX's limited liquidity pools, Liquidity Hub enhances this process by utilizing additional liquidity sources:

1) **On-chain solver auction:** Third-party solvers who compete to fill swaps using on-chain liquidity like AMM pools or their private inventory.
2) **Decentralized orders via API:** Decentralized orders are accessible using API, enabling institutional/professional traders, such as market makers, to submit bids and compete to fill swaps.

Liquidity Hub allows DEXs to attempt to execute trades without going through the AMM and experiencing price impact. If the layer cannot execute the trade at a better price than the AMM, the transaction will return to the AMM contract and execute as usual.
