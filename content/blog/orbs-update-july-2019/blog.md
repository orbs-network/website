**In this update:** GLF Partnership ⁂ Hdac signing ⁂ Forbes feature ⁂ Orbs Awards distribution ⁂ App development guidelines ⁂ Founder interviews ⁂ and more

...

**Welcome back to our monthly recap everyone!** June brought with it lots of exciting news and industry recognition, which is of course really exciting. Having all this happen around the time of Orbs’ very first reward distribution event was, for those sitting at the Tel Aviv HQ, akin to celebrating a birthday on independence day.

Let’s dive right into it, shall we? First things first:

## GLF Participation

After several months of covert talks, the [Global Leader’s Forum](https://www.internationaltelecomsweek.com/about-itw/itw-global-leaders-forum), a consortium of global telco giants, including names like Orange, Sprint, Vodaphone, and Telefónica, [finally announced last week](https://interactive.itwglf.com/ITW-Global-Leaders-Forum/blockchain-1653ZN-8425NA.html) the formation of a thinktank to help create technological standards for blockchain use. This is a very exciting update that puts Orbs in the room with some of the strongest names in global telco, and we are grateful to be part of this important process in the planet’s technological future.

## Collaboration with Hdac and MOU Signing

Hdac is a subsidiary of Hyundai; the company was founded by the grandson of Hyundai’s chairman and they are currently developing a hybrid blockchain. Based on the MOU, the collaboration will mostly relate to Hdac’s new POS ecosystem, joint ventures in business development, benefiting from Hdac’s access to enterprises in Korea as well as mutual marketing.

## Orbs Around the World

### CryptoChicks event

CryptoChicks was a blockchain & AI conference AND hackathon in Toronto, Canada. The 3-day event that consists of talks by leaders such as Vitalik Buterin and Ben Goertzel, networking events with the thriving Toronto crypto community and lots of girl-coding-power. Orbs Head of Partnerships Danny Brown Wolf gave a keynote on Proof-of-Stake architecture. The theme was, these are all the problems in existing PoS designs, call BS on everything.

### Seattle event

Seattle DevCon on June 29th was a fantastic event by Coinstate, Blockcelerate and UW Blockchain Society! Seattle is always an interesting city to visit, with some amazing local DeFi projects and concentration of some of the largest enterprises in the world like Amazon, Microsoft, SAP, Expedia, and others of a similar caliber. Orbs Head of Partnerships Danny Brown Wolf spoke on two panels: _What’s new with Enterprise Blockchain?_ And: _Public & Private chains. Use cases_.

Moderated by Jan Young of Rabbit Hole Network, with IBM, Dragonchain & Hashgraph; Future Consensus: Proof of Stake & Staking Rewards. Is it the future? Pros & Cons moderated by Steve Floyd of Fractal (who signed the genesis EOS block!) and reps from Tezos Commons, and Ztake.

### Global Blockchain Summit

_[@jnoam](https://community.orbs.network/u/jnoam/)_ was invited by the Astana International Financial Center (AIFC), together with Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC), to participate in the Global Blockchain Summit on Nur Sultan, Kazakhstan. The summit included many visitors from the region, another step in Kazakhstan's effort to become a regional leader in financial technology and services. Jonathan was given the floor to present Orbs to this crowd and partake in panels about permissionless Blockchain infrastructure together with government officials and market-leading organizations such as Bitfury, China Blockchain Research Center, Suramitsu and others.

## Expansion Highlights

### Korea Visit - June 2019

Orbs’ President Daniel Peled and I went for our periodic visit to South Korea to meet the local team and long-time partners, as well as some new enterprises and potential partners such as the City of Seoul, banks, a media company, telecom companies, exchanges, and another major national conglomerate.

### City of Seoul

I had two followup meetings with the Seoul municipality following the Mayor’s visit in Israel last month during which we discussed the potential of a collaboration with their smart city group and more. The city of Seoul is a huge & respected entity, and it seems like we are off to a good start.

### Meetup

We had more than 100 RSVPs in less than 2 hours (!) from the moment the registration link was made available, a great indication of Orbs’ solid brand in Korea. We finished with 120 RSVPs and more than 70 ppl attending. The local community is very engaging and it is something everyone at Tel Aviv’s HQ is grateful for.

The event went very well, with the program of the event as follows:

- Opening remarks (Eddy)

- Overview of Orbs (Daniel)
- Closing remarks (Spunky)
