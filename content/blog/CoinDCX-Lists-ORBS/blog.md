ORBS has been listed on CoinDCX, India's biggest cryptocurrency exchange in terms of trading volume. This listing includes two trading pairs of Orbs, including one with the Indian Rupee (INR), specifically the ORBS/INR pair.

ORBS trading is now live on both CoinDCX App and Web:

- ORBS/INR - https://coindcx.com/trade/ORBSINR
- ORBS/USDT - https://coindcx.com/trade/ORBSUSDT

This addition to CoinDCX comes after Orbs' active involvement and sponsorship at the ETH India event in Bangalore last December. This listing follows other major listings for the ORBS project at high-tier spot and derivatives exchanges including Binance, Bybit, and OKX, among others.

The listing is part of Orbs' increasing connection to the crypto community in India.  There is significant potential and alignment in building a community in India to complement the existing local Orbs communities in Korea, Japan, and various English-speaking regions. 

Due to the [regulatory climate](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/12/28/india-issues-compliance-show-cause-notices-to-9-offshore-exchanges-including-binance-and-kucoin/) in India, CoinDCX is seen as a stable, compliant player that is now capturing the majority of the Indian crypto market. Some exciting metrics to make note of include: 

- India is the second-largest crypto market globally in terms of transaction volume, with $269 billion recorded between July 2022 and June 2023.
- An estimated 97.5 million people, or 7.1% of India's population, currently own cryptocurrency​.
- India is home to over 900 cryptocurrency-related enterprises, constituting 11% of the global Web3 developer community as of 2022.
