A quick reminder. The [Orbso NFT collection](https://opensea.io/collection/orbso-universe-gang) consists of 77 exclusively designed Orbso NFT cards, including a gang of 70 basic NFTs - Orbso Mobsters (divided into seven groups of ten), plus a special and even more exciting group of 7 unique NFTs - Orbso Bosses.
