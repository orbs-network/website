The Orbs team is excited to announce that Orbs is now available on The Graph Protocol – [TheGraph.com](https://thegraph.com/), the most prominent indexing protocol for querying decentralized networks such as Ethereum and building and publishing open APIs.

The integration with The Graph allows anyone interested in the Orbs project to access data regarding the Orbs ecosystem from the Ethereum blockchain and create their own subgraphs. The Graph makes it easier for users who are more used to traditional databases to work with information stored on blockchain networks and access historic data without running expensive archive nodes.

By integrating with TheGraph.com, Orbs is joining a list of prominent DeFi projects, such as Uniswap, which are relying on The Graph protocol to provide analytics and historical analysis over pairs, trades and volume – [https://info.uniswap.org](https://info.uniswap.org) is actually driven entirely from The Graph – [https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/uniswap/uniswap-v2](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/uniswap/uniswap-v2)

### Transparency and Auditability

Orbs is proud to be a decentralized, open project where anyone can participate in the Orbs ecosystem. As part of this, it is important that all participants be able to audit the ecosystem and get accurate and transparent information. By being part of the Graph protocol, validator nodes of The Graph now actively index and audit Orbs data directly from Orbs PoS contracts on Ethereum, reviewing important metrics such as the Orbs committee of elected Guardians.

Integration with The Graph follows on the transparency already created with the launch of previous analytic tools such as the Orbs Universe Analytics and the Orbs Community Console (created together with Flipside Crypto). Integration with The Graph builds on these initiatives and adds a new dimension – the ability of users to design their own queries and build their own analytic tools based on their individual specifications.

### Exploring Orbs Graphs

The first Orbs ecosystem data available on the Graph protocol is the current status of elected Orbs Guardians:

The information is also available to consume as API by third-party developers through the GraphQL HTTP endpoint:

[https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/orbs-network/guardians](https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/orbs-network/guardians)

This interface allows anyone to query information regarding the Guardians, including their details, committee membership, voting power and certification status. This information will help delegators make informed decisions in selecting Guardians and assist clients in verifying they are indeed communicating with the correct Orbs nodes.

As a community tool, the Orbs team welcomes others to create their own queries and subgraphs with additional information.

## Additional On-chain Tools

As mentioned above, the Orbs project puts a great deal of emphasis on transparency as well as community involvement. Here are 3 useful on-chain tools that can provide a lot of information and insights –

### Orbs PoS Analytics

The [Orbs Universe Analytics](https://analytics.orbs.network/overview/stake) Dashboard was developed by the Orbs team as of the Orbs Pos V2: The Age of Guardians [launch](/orbs-pos-v2-5-official-launch). It aggregates everything you need to know about the Orbs PoS Universe in one place, for both Delegators and Guardians.

### The Orbs Community Console

[The](https://orbs.flipsidecrypto.com/) Orbs [Community Console](https://orbs.flipsidecrypto.com/) is a joint collaboration between the Orbs team and [Flipside Crypto](https://www.flipsidecrypto.com/). The Console displays and highlights key performance indicators for the Orbs network, by tracking relevant on-chain metrics to decode stakeholder behavior and drive network growth.

The Orbs Community Console assists team and community members alike with learning which specific activities are driving growth on the Orbs network and understand metrics that are not just limited to price and market cap.

### Orbs PoS Portal on Staking Rewards

This is another collaboration, this time with [Staking Rewards](https://www.stakingrewards.com/), the leading data provider for staking and crypto-growth tools.

The Orbs PoS [portal](https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/orbs) on Staking Rewards offers a comprehensive portal with all of the relevant information for staking the ORBS tokens: from key metrics and statistics, ORBS [staking calculator](https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/orbs/calculate), staking providers (also called Orbs Guardians), Tutorials on how to stake, and much more…
