Alright, everyone! August has been a relatively quiet month for many of us, and yours truly is happy to watch his colleagues return from vacations all sunburned and happy. This post is going to be a quick flash update, so you know what has been happening while you were out sipping lemonade:

### ORBS on Samsung Wallet

In the stealth of night and without too much fuss, ORBS token was added to Samsung’s blockchain wallet. The token is 3# in the app, following Bitcoin and Ethereum, and will now be easier than ever to hold:

### Messari Disclosure Registry

Orbs is proud to announce having joined the Messari Registry!

### Danny on SF Panel

_(Contributed by Danny Brown Wolf)_

I spoke on a Blockchain by Women panel on the Pilot to Production hosted by ConsenSys and Target Open House. It was packed and fun!

The panel was led by Cecily Mak, a Venture Partner at ConsenSys, with Daisy Ozim who works on Blockchain for Social Justice and Teresa Rabenberg Grobecker CEO of [reConsortia](https://reconsortia.com/) (tracking real-estate referrals, partnered with the national organisation of realtors in the US).

ReConsortia [CTO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claudiocebpaz/) was there and told me that although he DOESNT want to deal with any infrastructure maintenance, he is working with enterprise ethereum and building a custom IPFS solution because no blockchain can solve his storage needs (they have a NFT for every property in the US and want to build layers of information for every property).

That’s all from me, we are quite excited to be coming back to work at full swing now that things are back to normal at the HQ!
