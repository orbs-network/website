**Pangolin users can now farm PNG tokens on the ORBS-AVAX pool and earn ORBS tokens in Pangolin’s Single-stake feature!**

After [recently](https://www.orbs.com/ORBS-is-Now-Available-on-Pangolin/) adding the Orbs tokens to their platform, [Pangolin](https://app.pangolin.exchange/#/swap) are now launching farming and Single-stake for ORBS. Users can now farm Pangolin’s native token, PNG, by providing liquidity to the ORBS-AVAX pool which can then be staked to earn ORBS tokens.

The launch of ORBS farming and staking by Pangolin, one of the leading DEX-AMMs on the Avalanche network, is another important step to solidify the Orbs community’s presence on Avalanche. This follows other successful protocol integrations on the Avalanche network such as [AvaScan](https://www.orbs.com/ORBS-is-now-live-on-AvaScan/) and [Trader Joe](https://www.orbs.com/ORBS-is-now-live-on-Trader-Joe/). 

Be sure to check out our blog post on how to [bridge](https://www.orbs.com/AnySwap-Avalanche/) ORBS onto Avalanche, in order to be able to participate in Orbs farming and staking on Pangolin.

### Orbs Farming on Pangolin

Orbs token holders can earn PNG tokens by [adding liquidity](https://docs.pangolin.exchange/getting-started-on-pangolin/stake-liquidity) to the ORBS-AVAX pool. By adding liquidity you will receive PGL tokens, which is a representation of your ownership of the pool. 

Users can then Deposit their PGL tokens in the Orbs farm to participate in [liquidity mining](https://docs.pangolin.exchange/getting-started-on-pangolin/liquidity-mining) and earn PNG rewards.

### Stake PNG - Earn Orbs

Pangolin’s [Single-stake](https://app.pangolin.exchange/#/stake/0) feature enables users to deposit and stake their PNG tokens to earn ORBS without the risk of impermanent loss.

Using Single-staking is very easy and user-friendly. 
Here is a short [tutorial](https://docs.pangolin.exchange/getting-started-on-pangolin/staking-png) by Pangolin on how to use this feature.

Orbs is currently one of only four tokens which have been added to Pangolin’s staking. This is a great vote of confidence by Pangolin in the Orbs project!
