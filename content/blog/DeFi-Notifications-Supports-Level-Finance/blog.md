**The Open DeFi Notifications Protocol has integrated with LEVEL Finance, the first Perp DEX to integrate!**

[LEVEL](https://level.finance/) is an omnichain decentralized and non-custodial perpetual exchange offering a unique user-elected risk management framework built entirely from the ground up, enabling bespoke and innovative solutions for liquidity providers.LEVEL has facilitated over $18 billion trading volume and accrued over $23M in protocol revenue in just 5 months since launching, marking it the most successfully launched perpetual exchange in DeFi.

LEVEL users can now set up ‘limit order executed’ and ‘liquidation’ notifications to provide 24/7 monitoring of trades.


The [Open DeFi Notification Protocol](https://defi.org/notifications/) App is available on the [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp).

_The Open DeFi Notification Protocol by defi.org is a community led initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events._

### The Best Way to Monitor Open Positions

When [trading](https://app.level.finance/trade) with leverage on LEVEL, users must be conscious of liquidation risks which happen when an open trade position cannot cover the margin fee ($5) or is lower than the maintenance margin (1% of Position Size) which will result in liquidation. Thus, users currently  must wait at their computers to know their order's liquidation status. 

Additionally, when trading with Limit Orders on LEVEL, tracking and knowing if an order has been filled can be cumbersome without being present on the webpage.

Well, not anymore!

Using the Open DeFi Notification Protocol, LEVEL users can set up **“Limit Order Executed”** and **“Liquidation”** notifications which will issue an alert when a trader's position is liquidated, or their limit order has been filled. In this way, users have 24/7 monitoring of their position status and can take immediate action.

**The app supports over 30 protocols across 7 networks: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Fantom, Cronos, Avalanche, and Arbitrum!**
