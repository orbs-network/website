[Splassive](https://splassive.com/), a leading passive income protocol on AVAX, has integrated The Open DeFi Notifications Protocol!

Splassive users can now earn more effectively, knowing their reward status at all times, by receiving instant alerts around the clock when they reach ‘tap max reward’.  

[The Open DeFi Notification Protocol](https://defi.org/notifications/) App is available on both [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp).

_The Open DeFi Notification Protocol by [defi.org](https://defi.org/) is a community led initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events._


### The Best Way to Monitor Your Rewards

Splassive is a protocol on AVAX that refers to itself as an ROI dApps that offers a fixed APR on its primary token.

Splassive users can stake their tokens to earn a 2% yield daily. However, one of their main features of staking is that stakers cannot earn rewards for 48 hours straight. Instead, after 48 hours they need to make a decision to either compound or claim. Making them a perfect fit for Defi.org’s Notification app. 

Using the Open DeFi Notification Protocol, Splassive users can set up a **“Tap Max rewards”** notification. This will issue an alert when traders staked tokens reach the 48-hour mark and can no longer earn yield. In this way, users have 24/7 monitoring of their staked positions status and can take the necessary actions to manage them as needed.

### A Notification Standard for Leading DeFi Projects

The Open DeFi Notification Protocol is an open initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events. 


The addition of Splassive makes for an impressive lineup of leading DeFi projects who have already been integrated into the Open DeFi Notification app for the benefit of their users, including among others: Aave, Uniswap, SushiSwap, QuickSwap, PancakeSwap and more…

**All in all, the app supports over 20 protocols across 5 networks: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Fantom and Avalanche!**
