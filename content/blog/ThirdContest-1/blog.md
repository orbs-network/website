Dear Orbs enthusiasts,

You asked? We heard you. **Orbs' third NFTs contest starts today!**

As you all know, we're continuing to run our exciting series of contests to give out the entire Orbso Gang [NFT collection](https://opensea.io/collection/orbso-universe-gang) designed and dedicated to the Orbs community.

What makes this contest special?¬†

Well, the Orbs team has recently launched its first product as part of its L3 initiative: [The Open DeFi Notification Protocol!](https://www.orbs.com/notifications-launch/)

And of course, we want to celebrate this important milestone with you, the Orbs community, by running the next contest focused on the Notification app.
