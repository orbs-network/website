In May 2024, the Orbs project introduced [Perpetual Hub](https://www.orbs.com/perpetual-hub/), a one-stop shop for intent-based perpetual futures trading, powered by Orbs Layer-3 (L3) technology.It was a bold step forward in redefining how derivatives are traded on-chain.

Today, we’re taking it to the next level \- 

Introducing **Perpetual Hub Ultra**: a fully integrated, chain-native perps trading protocol that any DEX can adopt and deploy, with a completely customized user interface. 

This marks a major evolution in on-chain derivatives — and yes, it’s a big deal. 

Here’s why…

Perps \- the Next Big Thing in DeFi

On-chain perpetual futures (*perps*) are arguably the hottest thing in DeFi right now\!

Perps trading has long been a challenge. But with recent innovations in on-chain infrastructure, high-performance perps platforms have emerged. Notably, Hyperliquid has demonstrated the potential for [billions](https://stats.hyperliquid.xyz/) in open interest (OI) and trading volume.

## But technology alone isn't enough.

While the tech stack has matured, it’s not the full solution. Many projects launching perps trading platforms continue to face hurdles in delivering sufficient liquidity and competitive margin requirements to their users. This results in platforms like Hyperliquid monopolizing on chain perp trading. 

This is exactly where **Orbs** and **Symm.io** make the difference.

[Symm.io](http://Symm.io) has developed an innovative intent-based perpetual trading model that delivers unparalleled [capital efficiency](https://docs.symm.io/overview/introduction-to-symmio/comparing-capital-efficiency), being able to outsource liquidity from on-chain and off-chain sources (including major centralized exchanges like Binance).

Intent-based trading originally emerged in the spot market, where it now dominates DEX volumes. Platforms like UniswapX, 1inch Fusion, and CoWSwap have captured significant market share by leveraging this model to **aggregate liquidity across sources**, offering users better prices and improved execution.

Now, Symm.io and Orbs are extending this powerful mechanism to the perps market. **Symm.io** provides the robust smart contract infrastructure while Orbs L3 powers **Perpetual Hub Ultra**. Together, this software package enables DEXs to seamlessly launch a complete on-chain perps trading platform — combining deep liquidity, capital efficiency, and a professional-grade UI/UX experience.

Trade Perps on any DEX

Centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance and OKX offer both spot and perpetual (perps) trading. Perps trading volume is usually an order of magnitude higher than its spot counterpart due to the ability to use leverage. This is what makes it so valuable for CEXs.

However, until now, launching a decentralized perpetual trading platform has been a significant challenge. Hyperliquid had to build its own specialized L1 from scratch to achieve the suitable metrics.

**Perpetual Hub Ultra** is the next step in on-chain derivatives, enabling any DEX to seamlessly integrate software for a complete perps trading platform on multiple leading chains, powered by Orbs’ advanced L3 technology.

For DEXs that don't wish to be left behind with spot trading only, this is a pivotal opportunity. Integrating Perpetual Hub Ultra has the potential to significantly boost trading volume, attract new users, and drive revenue growth, without having to develop a new specialized base layer.

What makes Perpetual Hub Ultra truly exciting is its **B2B2C scalability**. By offering a fully modular stack — including the trading UI, hedger, liquidator, and oracle — the system is ready for immediate integration. This means that any DEX can onboard with minimal development effort, accelerating the rollout of perpetual trading across the ecosystem. As more platforms integrate Perpetual Hub Ultra, the network of venues and users grows rapidly, driving adoption at scale and positioning this model as the **standard for on-chain perps**.

Major DEX integrations are already underway on multiple major chains, with several prominent platforms joining as design partners.

Deep Liquidity with CeFi-level UI/UX

Perpetual Hub Ultra is a complete perps trading software package that features:

- **CeFi-grade UI/UX** that’s customizable to the host DEX

- Full suite of trading services, including:

  - Hedger

  - Liquidator

  - Price oracle

With [Symm.io](http://Symm.io) as the smart contract infrastructure, Perpetual Hub Ultra is able to provide deep liquidity on day one, comparable to Hyperliquid and even Binance, thanks to its innovative intent-based hedger technology.

The best part? All of this is available through a streamlined integration flow, across multiple supported chains.

This turnkey approach not only ensures top-tier performance on day one, but t also allows for rapid deployment across many DEXs and chains, multiplying user access and accelerating adoption ecosystem-wide.

**L3 for Advanced On-chain Trading**

Orbs is a decentralized Layer-3 (L3) blockchain designed specifically for advanced on-chain trading.

Orbs acts as a decentralized backend that powers unique protocols, including dLIMIT, dTWAP, Liquidity Hub, and Perpetual Hub. These, in turn, optimize trading with aggregated liquidity, advanced trading orders, and on-chain derivatives, which push the boundaries of DeFi and on-chain trading.
