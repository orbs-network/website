**[Carbon browser](https://carbon.website/), a decentralized web3 browser, has added support for the ORBS token, the native token of the Orbs network to their wallet functionality.** 

Carbon boasts over 5.7 million downloads alongside a growing community of 45,000 daily active users (DAUs) who will be able to interact with ORBS seamlessly as they browse the web.  

Carbon was originally a web 2.0 browser relaunched to support the needs of web 3.0 users. Carbon open-sourced its code and built a privacy and security-focused browser. Backed by Binance Chain, Poolz, TrustSwap, and Curate with current integrations with Sui, Polygon, and Akash network, Carbon is able to provide the following advantages: 

- ~0.5 Average page load time
- Free VPN + dVPN
- Fully functional AdBlock
- ENS Domains, Unstoppable, and Handshake web3 support
- Multichain wallet
- Atomic swaps
-  & more

Now with Orbs functionality, Carbon will be a one-stop solution for those looking to combine the advantages of a traditional browser with all the perks that web 3.0 has to offer. At the time of writing Carbon only supports Android with IOS, Mac, and Windows support coming soon. 

Carbon aligns with the Orbs project’s philosophy Orbs that products should protect users' privacy and data, support open-source development and facilitate community governance. The collaboration between the two projects comes at a time with increased activity from the Orbs community. [dTWAP](https://www.orbs.com/dtwap/) is now live on SpookySwap, SpiritSwap and Pangolin DEX, parallel with active development on the TON ecosystem with [TON.Vote](https://ton.vote/) advancing L3 use cases.

**About Orbs** 

The Orbs Network is an open, decentralized, public blockchain infrastructure executed by a secure network of permissionless validators using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. 

Orbs is set up as a separate decentralized execution layer operating between existing L1/L2 solutions and the application layer, as part of a tiered blockchain stack, without moving liquidity onto a new chain. Orbs acts as a “decentralized backend”, enhancing the capabilities of existing smart contracts and opening up a whole new spectrum of possibilities for Web 3.0, DeFi, NFTs and GameFi. 

Orbs was founded in 2017 and launched its mainnet and token in March of 2019. Orbs is being developed by a dedicated team of more than 30 people, with team members in Tel Aviv, London, New York, Tokyo and Seoul.
