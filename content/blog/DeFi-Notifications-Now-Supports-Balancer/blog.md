**The Open DeFi Notifications Protocol has integrated with Balancer, one of the oldest and largest protocols in DeFi with over 900M in TVL!**

Balancer is a decentralized automated market maker (AMM) protocol built on Ethereum that represents a flexible building block for programmable liquidity. By separating the AMM curve logic and math from the core swapping functionality, Balancer becomes an extensible AMM that can incorporate any number of swap curves and pool types. Learn more [here](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/overview/basics.html#what-is-balancer).

Balancer users can now set up a **‘Pending Reward’** or **‘Staking Unlocked’** notification to receive real-time updates to their staking profile. 

The [Open DeFi Notification Protocol](https://defi.org/notifications/) App is available on the [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp).

_The Open DeFi Notification Protocol by defi.org is a community led initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events._


### Stay up to date with staking strategies on-chain

veBAL (vote-escrow BAL) is a vesting system based on Curve's veCRV mechanism which locks 80/20 BAL/WETH Balancer Pool Tokens for a maximum of 1 year. The veBAL and Gauge system is designed to promote long-term token-holder alignment and facilitate fair protocol fee distribution. By locking the BAL/WETH 80/20 BPT, holders are given veBAL, entitling them to governance rights and protocol fee collection. 


Users staking veBAL require restaking their rewards for the maximum ROI, but this can be tricky to keep track of on-chain and can be missed whilst participating in other pools offered by the protocol.

Using the Open DeFi Notification Protocol, Balancer users can set up a **“Staking Unlocked”** notification to alert them on their veBAL unlocking events.


In addition, users can also set up a **“Pending Reward”** notification to alert them of BAL rewards waiting to be claimed when providing Liquidity on the platform.

### A Notification Standard for Leading DeFi Projects

The Open DeFi Notification Protocol is an open initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events. 

The addition of Balancer makes for an impressive lineup of leading DeFi projects that have already been integrated into the Open DeFi Notification app for the benefit of their users, including, among others: Aave, Uniswap, SushiSwap, QuickSwap, PancakeSwap, and more…

**The app supports over 30 protocols across 7 networks: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Fantom, Cronos, Avalanche, and Arbitrum!**
