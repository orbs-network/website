QuickSwap, an OG DEX and long-time user of Orbs protocols, has integrated Perpetual Hub Ultra, powered by Orbs, bringing institutional grade perpetual futures trading to Base. This integration positions Orbs as the go-to solution for DEXs seeking a plug-and-play perps infrastructure to expand their current offerings.

With this upgrade, QuickSwap users gain access to deep liquidity, customizable leverage, and efficient execution, all through a fully managed, modular perps stack.

Powered by Orbs’ Layer-3 infrastructure, this deployment builds on successful integrations of Perpetual Hub \[legacy\], cementing Orbs as the industry standard for turnkey perps infrastructure in DeFi.

[*Orbs*](https://www.orbs.com/) *is a decentralized infrastructure layer executed by a public network of permissionless validators using dPoS, staked with tens of millions of dollars in total value locked (TVL). Orbs Layer-3 infrastructure optimizes on-chain trading by providing aggregated liquidity, advanced trading orders, and decentralized derivatives, enabling a DeFi trading experience as efficient as CeFi.*

## **About Perpetual Hub Ultra**

Perpetual Hub Ultra is a fully integrated perpetual futures trading protocol developed by Orbs and Symm.io. It provides everything needed by DEXs looking to launch a high-performance perps platform, including hedging, liquidation, oracles, and a professional grade UI, all powered by Orbs’ Layer 3 decentralized infrastructure and Symm.io’s smart contract system.

Built for scalability and capital efficiency, once integrated, Ultra enables platforms to route liquidity from both onchain and offchain sources, including major centralized exchanges like Binance. This allows protocols to offer deep execution without needing to build a specialized chain or complex backend. By packaging the full perps stack into a modular integration layer, Ultra allows DEXs, frontends, and aggregators to deploy perps with minimal development effort and fast time to market.

As intent based trading continues to dominate DEX volume in spot markets, Perpetual Hub Ultra brings this same model to perps, enabling a new generation of trading venues to compete with centralized exchanges in performance, flexibility, and user experience while remaining fully decentralized.

## **About QuickSwap**

QuickSwap is a leading decentralized exchange with deployments on multiple chains, including Polygon PoS, Base, Polygon zkEVM, Manta Pacific, Immutable zkEVM, Soneium, X Layer, and Somnia. As the home of the DragonFi ecosystem, QuickSwap offers a comprehensive suite of DeFi products, including swaps, liquidity provision, farming, staking, and perpetual trading, all with fast transaction speeds and low fees.

Launched in October 2021, QuickSwap was created to address the high gas fees and slow transaction times of other networks. It is supported by industry veterans such as Nick Mudge (author of the Diamond Standard), Sameep Singhania (blockchain developer and founder of Ginete Technologies), and Roc Zacharias (CEO of Lunar Digital Assets), who continue to guide its growth and innovation across DeFi and beyond.
