**Orbs Staking is now available on Token Pocket Wallet!**

We are excited to announce that ORBS staking is now available on the Token Pocket Wallet mobile app, for Android and iOS, using the mobile version of Orbs’ Tetra Wallet. This means that Orbs token holders can now stake their ORBS tokens directly from their Token Pocket wallet application.

### How to Stake ORBS Using the Token Pocket Wallet Browser

The staking process is super-easy! All you need to do is navigate to the [Tetra webpage](https://staking.orbs.network/) from your Token Pocket mobile app and stake your Orbs. Not sure how to use Tetra? Check out this simple [tutorial](/tetra-orbs-staking-wallet-tutorial).

### Token Pocket – Make Blockchain Happen Everywhere

Token Pocket is a trusted multi-chain wallet that allows its users to easily store, send and receive all of the main cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), EOS, TRON (TRX), IOST, Cosmos, Binance (BNB), and more…

With its powerful Web3 browser, Token Pocket lets its users interact with over 2000 Decentralized Applications (DApp), trade ERC20 tokens, BTC, and EOS in decentralized exchanges (DEX), and play blockchain games directly inside the wallet.

Token Pocket is an open-sourced decentralized wallet, with an emphasis on security: With the “Observation Mode”, TokenPocket can access any cold storage wallet – Trezor, Ledger, Yubikey, etc., without exposing your private key. Token Pocket also uses advanced biotechnology to ensure the safety of its users’ assets, providing secondary protection even if the phone is unlocked.
