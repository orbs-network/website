### Orbs and QuickSwap are excited to announce the launch of Orbs on the Dragon's Syrup Pool!

### A Quick Recap:

The Orbs project has been expanding its ecosystem over the last year, moving towards integration with all major blockchains. One of the most exciting integrations was with Polygon, which was accomplished by [bridging](https://www.orbs.com/how-to-bridge-orbs-tokens-onto-the-polygon-network/) the ORBS token into Polygon, and then integrating  the bridged Orbs token with QuickSwap, the Polygon DeFi ecosystem's biggest and most active DEX-AMM.. As of this writing, QuickSwap has over $879M in Total Value Locked (TVL) and over $59M in daily volume.

According to QuickSwap's [Orbs token page](https://info.quickswap.exchange/#/token/0x614389eaae0a6821dc49062d56bda3d9d45fa2ff), currently, there are several active ORBS pools on QuickSwap:

-   USDC-ORBS, with liquidity of ~$969k

-   ORBS-QUICK, with liquidity of ~$62k

### Dragon's Syrup: a New Way to Generate Yield on QuickSwap

The "Dragon's Syrup" is a program launched by QuickSwap to allow $QUICK token stakers to earn extra rewards by staking their $dQUICK (the asset you receive when you deposit your Quick into the staking contract) to earn tokens that are traded on the DEX.

Put simply, users deposit QUICK, and get a variable rate of dQUICK in return. The value of dQUICK increases over time as swap fees are generated. When unstaking (or "withdrawing" from the staking contract), your dQuick is burned, and you get back more QUICK than you put in --- based on the dQUICK rate.

Dragon's Syrup enables QUICK stakers to generate an extra yield from staking in the Dragon's Lair by distributing tokens to those who stake their dQUICK in the Dragons' Syrup rewards pools.

### Here's How it Works:

1.  Provide liquidity in the '[ORBS Pools](https://info.quickswap.exchange/#/pair/0xb2b6d423e535b57aad06e9866803b95fb66152ea)' to earn LP (liquidity provider) tokens, as well as a 0.25% share in the trading fees on all trades in the pool.

1.  Deposit LP tokens from step 1 to the Quick liquidity mining pool using the '[Farms -> LP Mining](https://quickswap.exchange/#/quick)' tab to earn QUICK.

1.  Stake your QUICK in Dragon's Lair on the same '[Farms -> LP Mining](https://quickswap.exchange/#/quick)' tab to get dQUICK --- This gets you a share of ALL trading fees that QuickSwap generates.
