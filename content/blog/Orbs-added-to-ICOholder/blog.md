**About Orbs**

The Orbs Network is an open, decentralized, and public blockchain infrastructure executed by a secure network of permissionless validators using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus.

Orbs is set up as a separate decentralized execution layer operating between existing L1/L2 solutions and the application layer, as part of a tiered blockchain stack, without moving liquidity onto a new chain. Orbs acts as a "decentralized backend", enhancing the capabilities of existing smart contracts and opening up a whole new spectrum of possibilities for Web 3.0, DeFi, NFTs and GameFi.

Orbs was founded in 2017 and launched its mainnet and token in March 2019. Orbs is being developed by a dedicated team of more than 40 people, with team members in Tel Aviv, London, New York, Tokyo, and Seoul.
