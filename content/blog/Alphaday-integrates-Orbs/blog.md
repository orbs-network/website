[Alphaday](https://alphaday.com/), a popular web3 dashboard for all related happenings in the broader ecosystem has received a grant from the Orbs Ecosystem Grant Program, designed to support founders launching the next wave of DeFi innovation whilst adhering to decentralized principles. 

Alphaday provides a sleek, modular user interface to follow your favorite projects, stay up-to-date with the latest narratives, and use your favorite dApps. They manage this all under one roof that allows web3 login. The founders include former Consensys members, Kyber Network, and [DeFi Dude](https://twitter.com/defidude?lang=en), a previous Aave contributor.

Alphaday has integrated the Orbs protocol, creating a dashboard for all related project happenings. Orbs joins the website's front page alongside key ecosystem protocols including Avalanche, Arbitrum, Verasity, and more.

Diving deeper into the dashboard, the Orbs board contains an RSS feed for the Orbs blog, news surrounding the project, current market price, YouTube uploads, Twitter feed, governance, and much more all under one roof. In addition, you can move, minimize/maximize, delete, or add more widgets containing project information as you see fit to create a completely customizable dashboard.

The integration of Orbs by the Alphaday team is an excellent place to learn more about Orbs, or keep up to date with current happenings if you’re already familiar with the project. The tool is rapidly growing and acquiring new users, and Orbs is excited to be featured on a growing DeFi project that is user-friendly-oriented. 

Beyond Orbs, you can leverage Alphaday for all sorts of web3-related data including podcasts, web3 offline events calendar, videos, highest ETH TVL, gas guzzlers, and much more data both on- and off-chain.

**About Orbs**

The Orbs Network is an open, decentralized, public blockchain infrastructure executed by a secure network of permissionless validators using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. 

Orbs is a separate decentralized execution layer operating between existing L1/L2 solutions and the application layer, as part of a tiered blockchain stack, without moving liquidity onto a new chain. Orbs acts as a “decentralized backend”, enhancing the capabilities of existing smart contracts and opening up a whole new spectrum of possibilities for Web 3.0, DeFi, NFTs, and GameFi. 

Orbs was founded in 2017 and launched its mainnet and token in March of 2019. Orbs is being developed by a dedicated team of more than 30 people, with team members in Tel Aviv, London, New York, Tokyo, and Seoul.
