### Orbs Goes Live on Serum

🔹After successfully bridging the ORBS token via Solana's Wormhole cross-chain bridge and going live on Raydium, Orbs went live on [Serum](https://www.orbs.com/Serum/), further expanding its ecosystem.

🔹Serum's on-chain central limit order book and matching engine provides liquidity and price-time-priority matching to traders and composing projects. Now, you can add liquidity to Orbs pool which is currently available on Raydium for ORBS-SOL, with a total liquidity of ~$58K. In return you will receive trading fees for that pair, and LP Tokens that you may stake elsewhere to earn additional rewards.

### Orbs Ecosystem Growth: Harmony!

🔹As you probably know, Orbs keeps strengthening its position as a multi-chain asset across the DeFi space. So, the project's next step has been integrating with Harmony, as it brings together several key blockchain innovations, such as faster settlement, shorter withdrawal wait times and gas-efficient interoperability.

🔹Moreover, bringing the Orbs ecosystem to Harmony introduces new opportunities to explore deep sharding. The sharding approach of this network uses adaptive proof-of-Stake to maintain strong network security. More so, the current Total Locked Value (TVL) on the Harmony chain is over $508M, with a clear uptrend of growth.

### ORBS Goes Live on Harmony Using the Horizon Cross-Chain Bridge

🔹To start its chain integration with Harmony, Orbs went live on the Horizon bridge, the official cross-chain bridge recently launched by Harmony.

🔹In order to bridge Orbs onto Harmony, you can pick the ORBS token from the pulldown list in the Horizon Bridge page. Orbs holders can select between Ethereum and BSC chains.
