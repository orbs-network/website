Orbs is Now Live on Serum!


In light of the skyrocketing popularity of DeFi (Orbs followers know that the project has been focused on unlocking the [potential of Orbs in the DeFi space](https://www.orbs.com/Introducing-Open-DeFi-Notification-Protocol/)), the latest step forward for the Orbs ecosystem is [integrating ORBS tokens](https://www.orbs.com/Orbs-is-Live-on-the-Solana-Wormhole-Bridge/) with Solana's leading DeFi ecosystem - one of the most productive DeFi ecosystems in the crypto-verse at the moment.

After successfully bridging the ORBS token via Solana's Wormhole cross-chain [bridge](https://wormholebridge.com/#/) and going live on [Raydium](https://raydium.io/), we're excited to announce that Orbs is now available on Serum, thus further expanding its ecosystem.

Fast & Powerful Ecosystem

[Serum](https://www.projectserum.com/roadmap) is a protocol and ecosystem built on Solana that brings speed and affordable transaction costs to decentralized finance. Serum ecosystem partners can compose with Serum's on-chain central limit order book to share liquidity and power markets-based features.

More specifically, Serum's on-chain central limit order book and matching engine provides liquidity and price-time-priority matching to traders and composing projects. Users may take advantage of this exchange model through the ability to choose the price, size and direction of their trades. Composing projectsÂ  can benefit from Serum's architecture, liquidity, and matching service.

Serum's First Mover & AMM

Let's take a closer look at Raydium and deeper explore its connection to Serum. Raydium is an automated market maker (AMM) built on the Solana blockchain for the Serum Decentralized Exchange (DEX). Raydium's major goal is to bring new and existing projects looking to grow and expand to Solana and Serum ecosystems. Having first-mover's advantage as an AMM, Raydium provides an opportunity for token owners to earn fees by giving liquidity. Raydium LPs thought to get access to the entire order flow and liquidity of Serum. Moreover, Raydium's platform enables swapping and trading to earn yield on digital assets. Thus, we can think of Raydium as a bridge between Serum and a wide range of projects looking for further growth opportunities.

Now, you can add liquidity to Orbs pool which is currently available on [Raydium](https://raydium.io/pools/) for ORBS-SOL, with a total liquidity of ~$58K. In return for adding liquidity, you will receive trading fees for that pair, and LP Tokens that you may stake elsewhere to earn additional rewards.

Cross-Chain Swap Solution

The Serum project intends to [solve the swapping issues](https://assets.website-files.com/61382d4555f82a75dc677b6f/61384a6d5c937269dbed185c_serum_white_paper.88d98f84.pdf) that cross-chain DeFi is currently facing. In general, despite being on Solana and having the speed and cost that go along with that, Serum is also fully usable from Ethereum. This means that existing DeFi projects can access Serum's features and liquidity directly from their native blockchain, creating fast integration between the current infrastructure and Serum.

Orbs is excited to further expand the list of successful integrations on the Solana network, exploring the possibilities and opportunities it presents.
