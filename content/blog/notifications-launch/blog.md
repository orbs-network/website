### The OPEN DeFi Notification Protocol - a Quick Recap

The Open DeFi Notification Protocol is a community inspired initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for crucial on-chain events:

- Free for use — **no subscription fees or ads!**
- Dependable — never miss an alert
- Multi network support — Ethereum, BSC, Polygon and more
- Community-led and open — public and decentralized alert nodes

With a quick 30 minute integration on Github, any DeFi project can provide its users with free mobile notifications for important events like accumulated pending rewards, price swings, near liquidations, stop loss, contract upgrades, new governance votes and more.



### A First-rate Lineup of Launch Partners

Right from the launch we already have a top-notch roster of leading DeFi protocols having their platform integrated into the Notification App. These protocols are across multiple chains such as Ethereum, BSC, Polygon and Avalanche, and multiple functionalities: DEX-AMMs, yield aggregators and vaults.

So that we can already see more and more DeFi projects interested in providing its users with free mobile notifications for crucial on-chain events.



### What’s Next…

We believe that real-time DeFi notifications are a critical piece of the DeFi infrastructure puzzle and its impact on the industry will be massive. Already we are seeing top protocols getting onboard to provide their users with this important functionality. We expect more top DeFi protocols to integrate the Open DeFi Notification Protocol and contribute additional notifications relevant for their use-cases and users.

Orbs is proud to be the first project to implement the protocol and contribute to the success of this initiative. The Open DeFi Notification protocol is also an example of Orbs’ [Layer-3 innovation](https://www.orbs.com/How-Orbs-Hybrid-Architecture-Is-Becoming-a-Game-Changer-in-DeFi/), as it utilizes a layer of infrastructure that can read a variety of activity on underlying Layer-1 and Layer-2 blockchains and provide information that allows DeFi users to execute more sophisticated and dynamic strategies.

Stay tuned for announcements of additional protocols integrating the Notification app and adding new alerts and functionalities!
