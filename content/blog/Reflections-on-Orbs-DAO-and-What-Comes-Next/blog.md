Over the past few years, I’ve had the privilege of watching Orbs evolve from a bold idea into something tangible and impactful. When we first spoke about “[Layer 3](https://www.orbs.com/overview/)” back in 2022, it was still an abstract vision — a way to bring real utility and decentralized execution to on-chain applications. Today, that vision has powered more than $3 billion in trading volume and generated over $3 million in gross protocol revenue.

Those aren’t just numbers to me. They represent years of building, trying, and learning alongside our community and partners. I’ve seen how products like [**dLIMIT**](https://www.orbs.com/dlimit/) and [**dTWAP**](https://www.orbs.com/dtwap/) moved from whiteboard sketches to integrations with teams like [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap/twap), [SushiSwap](https://www.sushi.com/ethereum/limit), and [QuickSwap](https://dapp.quickswap.exchange/swap/limit/ETH/0xB5C064F955D8e7F38fE0460C556a72987494eE17?chainId=137). This year, we took another big step with [**Perpetual Hub**](https://www.orbs.com/perpetual-hub/) and [**PH Ultra**](https://www.orbs.com/Orbs-Unveils-Perpetual-Hub-Ultra/). Launched in **July** and already live with **six** integrations, including OG DeFi names like [**QuickSwap**](https://www.qperps.exchange/trade), [**Thena**](https://perps.thena.fi/trade/BTCUSDT), and [**SpookySwap**](https://perps.spooky.fi). For me, the pace of that adoption is a strong signal that L3-native execution for advanced trading is filling a real need.

As we close one chapter and look to the next, I keep coming back to project administration, ownership, and decision making. After more than 8 years of development, adoption, and iteration, it is the right time to take the next step—a step toward deeper decentralization and community ownership.

That’s why I’m personally excited about working on the **Orbs DAO**. This isn’t just about governance mechanics; it’s about letting the people who hold $ORBS and who use and build on Orbs help define where it goes. The DAO will evolve from our current governance model and take on broader responsibilities; handling operation and administration of the network, shaping strategy, directing treasury use, and setting priorities based on what the ecosystem actually needs.

Alongside the DAO, we will be proposing a flexible **tokenomics framework** grounded in real utility:

* Net revenue from L3 products, integrations, and services flows into the ORBS treasury.

* The **DAO,** not the team, decides how to deploy it.

That flexibility matters. Markets change. Priorities change. The community can vote to burn tokens, deepen on-chain liquidity, reduce emissions, diversify reserves, or fund new initiatives, whatever best advances the protocol at that moment.

Earlier this week, I came across Hayden Adams’ [proposal](https://x.com/haydenzadams/status/1987990314997739625?s=46&t=dbCMJ9oX63cSTvWluiveww) to turn on Uniswap protocol fees and route them into a UNI buyback-and-burn mechanism. I believe it is an important milestone not only for Uniswap but for tokenomics design across the industry. Mechanics like buyback-and-burn have already proven themselves in leading protocols such as PancakeSwap, HyperLiquid, Aster, and others. I believe a similar direction could make sense for Orbs as well. Once the DAO is established, my first recommendation will be to explore a tokenomics upgrade centered on a buyback-and-burn driven by real L3 revenue. I also found Hayden’s suggestion to retroactively burn tokens representing historical protocol revenues particularly smart. Applying that analogy to Orbs, it may be both fair and healthy for the DAO to consider burning ORBS from the treasury to account for protocol fees that could have been burned since L3 use cases began generating revenue.

**DAO formation is already underway**. New governance and tokenomics will be implemented **after** the DAO is set up and operational. I hope to provide updates on progress in the near future.

Looking back at what we’ve shipped and how quickly partners have adopted it, it’s clear to me that Orbs has reached a level of maturity where community participation is no longer optional. It’s the logical next step.

To be clear, this post reflects **my** personal perspective, not a formal company statement or commitment. But I believe that done right, decentralization aligns builders, users, and long-term sustainability in ways that top-down models rarely can. I will try to make follow up posting as the DAO set up progress.

We’d be happy to hear any feedback from the community, Guardians, partners, and builders alike. Please share thoughts, concerns, and ideas on governance scope, net revenue usage, and tokenomics cadence.

As we move forward, my hope is that this new DAO and tokenomics model becomes a foundation for the next era of Orbs. One defined not just by what the team builds, but by what **we** all create together.
