**ORBS, the native token of the Orbs network, has been integrated with Squid, a cross-chain liquidity router on the Axelar network!**

Squid is a cross-chain DEX that allows users to swap their assets between blockchains and access applications across chains. Built on the Axelar Network - a blockchain that connects blockchains, enabling universal Web3 interoperability through token bridging and general message passing. 

ORBS is now available for swaps from Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, and Axelar between any of the other 10 supported EVM-compatible chains. For a full list, click [here](https://docs.widget.squidrouter.com/supported-chains-tokens-and-wallets).

Squid also has a widget being leveraged by numerous DEXs, including QuickSwap, StellaSwap, SpookySwap, and others, in an effort to enable cross-chain swaps as simple as possible from the user perspective. Orbs can now be found and swapped on the [app](https://www.squidrouter.com/) of Squid through any of the ‘plugin-uis’.

**About Squid**

Squid is the cross-chain swap and liquidity routing protocol on [Axelar Network](https://axelar.network/).

Squid utilizes existing DEXs to swap and send any native token between chains. This can be done via Squid’s SDK, Front End, or Contracts directly.

Swaps are composable with Axelar's generalized message passing, so Squid can enable one-click transactions between any application and any user using any asset.

Buy NFTs from any marketplace, use multi-chain DeFi, play a game on another chain, all without signing multiple transactions or downloading multiple wallets.
