#### We are excited to announce that the ORBS token is now available on SushiSwap!

SushiSwap is one of the prominent DEX protocols on the Ethereum network, ranked in 3rd place according to [Defipulse](https://defipulse.com/), with over $5.5B in Total Value Locked (TVL).

Despite a rocky start, SushiSwap has regained much of its reputation and popularity by the crypto community and remains a heavily community-driven project. In addition, the Sushi project is also [backed](https://news.bitcoin.com/defis-raw-deal-sushiswap-creator-transfers-multi-sig-control-to-ftx-ceo/) by some of the biggest players in the space such as FTX exchange and Yearn Finance, contributing to its ongoing success.

## How to Swap on Sushi

The Sushi DEX is known for its simple to use UI. Consequently, Swapping Orbs on Sushi is extremely easy and can be done in this [LINK](https://app.sushi.com/swap?outputCurrency=0xff56cc6b1e6ded347aa0b7676c85ab0b3d08b0fa).

As always, it is advisable to always [verify](/orbs-token-integrity) the correct Orbs contract address on Ethereum before engaging in any swap:

## Adding Liquidity

In addition to swapping, Orbs token holders can also add liquidity to the Orbs pool. Being a liquidity provider (LP) requires locking of Orbs and ETH in equal amounts and entitles the LP to a 0.25% fee, proportional to the share in the pool.

## Explore More About Orbs and DeFi

In the past year, the Orbs project has been very active in the DeFi space.

Watch this [video](https://koreablockchainweek.com/watch/-qwejixcidqweq) from KBW 2020 by Orbs co-founder, Tal Kol, to learn about Orbs’ unique position with respect toDeFi and what led us to believe DeFi is the most interesting field for blockchain innovation at this moment in time (this was the most-watched video at the conference btw).

Here are some of the current projects Orbs is working on:

### Liquidity Nexus: The dream of single-sided farming

[Liquidity NEXUS](/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service) is the newest DeFi project by the Orbs team. The idea behind the Orbs Liquidity Nexus is to implement single-sided farming in order to enable ETH and USDC only strategies on any DEX.

Read more about Orbs Liquidity Nexus to learn exactly how it works: [Introduction](https://medium.com/@talkol/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service-1c022c8f2d43), [Part 1](https://talkol.medium.com/single-sided-farming-on-any-dex-via-orbs-liquidity-nexus-part-1-520051f940d5), [Part 2](https://medium.com/@talkol/single-sided-farming-on-any-dex-via-orbs-liquidity-nexus-part-2-824e58057cb5), [Part 3](https://medium.com/@talkol/single-sided-farming-on-any-dex-via-orbs-liquidity-nexus-part-3-fb75efb2f91f). If you prefer code, see the contracts on [Github](https://github.com/orbs-network/nexus-sushiswap) or an [example harvest.finance vault](https://github.com/orbs-network/nexus-harvestfinance/tree/master/contracts/strategies/nexus) that utilizes them to get a high yield on ETH.

### DeFi.org Accelerator

On January 11, Orbs and Binance exchange announced that they are teaming up to promote innovation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space by serving as the first core sponsors of the [DeFi.org](https://defi.org/) accelerator, which bootstraps new projects and DeFi protocols.

### Orbs DeFi Portal

The [Orbs DeFi Portal](https://orbsdefi.com/) is a project by one of the Orbs project’s prominent contributors: Paradigm Fund. The portal aggregates everything you need to know about Orbs and DeFi in one place – real-time market data for Orbs liquidity pools, Education materials and how-to manuals for swapping and adding liquidity, research papers, and more…

### Orbs DeFi Grant Program

As a decentralized project, Orbs understands the power of community contributions and is always looking for ways to further expand the number of contributors developing the network and ecosystem. Orbs has launched a grant program to help fund these contributions.

The full details of the grant program are available [here](white-papers/orbs-grant-program-2).

### Orbs on Binance Smart Chain

The ORBS token has also been [integrated](/orbs-is-now-live-on-binance-smart-chain-via-anyswap-cross-chain-bridge) into the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), by utilizing [multichain.xyz](https://multichain.xyz/) as a cross-chain bridge between BSC and Ethereum. As a first step, Orbs is now available on [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/), the most popular DEX/AMM on BSC.

This is an important first milestone to gain a foothold for Orbs on the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. Read more [here](/orbs-is-now-live-on-pancakeswap).
