Orbs and PancakeSwap recently launched the Orbs Syrup Pool on BSC.

Soon after, Beefy Finance announced that they are adding Orbs to their vaults!

Beefy Finance employs automated strategies aimed to optimize yields from liquidity pools by compounding yield farm reward tokens back into your initially deposited asset. This provides a huge advantage over attempting to do this manually, saving on personal time and transaction fees, as well as manual errors.

1. Add liquidity to the ORBS-BUSD pool on PancakeSwap in the following link:

Once you supply liquidity to the pool, you will receive your **BUSD-ORBS LP** tokens, which you’ll be able to use in the next step.

If you are unsure of how to do step 1, watch our PancakeSwap tutorial video [here](/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-orbs-syrup-pool-on-pancakeswap).

2. Deposit the **BUSD-ORBS LP** tokens from step 1 into the Beefy Finance Orbs vault here:

And that’s it!

Beefy will now run the automated strategy to achieve the APY indicated in the vault UI.

### Alpaca Flavored Beefy Syrup?!

The collaboration between the Orbs community and the BSC ecosystem has been making [impressive progress](/orbs-on-bsc-status-update) in recent weeks.

Orbs holders have a variety of options to utilize the ORBS token in various DeFi applications on BSC. They can choose from one of the following options:

- Participate in the Orbs syrup pool on PancakeSwap, which is now the most popular Orbs pool on any DEX, both on BSC and Ethereum.
- Use the Orbs vaults on Beefy Finance to optimize your yield generation.
- Leverage yield farm and earn Orbs on [Alpaca Finance](/orbs-added-to-alpaca-finance-vaults).

Each option may appeal to a different category of users, depending on their comfort zone and risk appetite.

Having a well-rounded framework is important in order to incentivize Orbs token holders to participate in the Orbs ecosystem on BSC. In this way, the Orbs project’s presence on BSC has been solidified, and has gained much attention and interest for future growth and expansion.
