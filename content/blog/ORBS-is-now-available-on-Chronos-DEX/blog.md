The ORBS token is now available on [Chronos](https://app.chronos.exchange/), a leading DEX on Arbitrum that has integrated the dTWAP and dLIMIT trading orders powered by the Orbs network!

In a recent blog post we announced that the ORBS token is now [available on Arbitrum](https://www.orbs.com/orbs-expands-to-arbitrum-via-satellite-bridge-by-axelar/) using the Satellite cross-chain bridge by Axelar. Token swaps are available between Ethereum, BSC, and more. The token is also undergoing whitelisting on Arbiscan. 

Following these successful integrations, Arbitrum users can now swap and add liquidity to Orbs pools on Chronos.

### Before you Start

As always, before embarking onto a new chain, there are several things you need to do:

1. **Set up an Arbitrum-compatible wallet:** If youâ€™re using the Metamask wallet, here is a [quick guide](https://docs.arbitrum.io/getting-started-users) on how to configure Metamask for Arbi.
2. **Choose a cross-chain bridge:** You may use the Sattelite bridge described in our recent [blog post](https://www.orbs.com/Orbs-integrates-with-Satellite-by-Axelar/).
3. **Fund your Arbitrum wallet with ETH tokens:** You can now bridge ORBS tokens into your Arbitrum wallet. In addition, make sure to send some ETH tokens for gas. 

You are now ready to use Chronos on Arbitrum!

_Note: Exercise caution when working with 3rd party technologies, educate yourself regarding the risks involved, and read all security audits._

### Chronos: A community-driven liquidity layer & AMM on Arbitrum

Chronos is a one-stop decentralized trading platform on the Arbi network, combining DEX services, DeFi lending, and leveraged trading. 

Chronos already has an ORBS-USDC pool set up with approx. $40,000 in total liquidity. Orbs users can now swap ORBS tokens as well as add liquidity to the Orbs pool!
