Since Orbs Ltd. was established in 2017 and the production-ready Orbs Network mainnet was launched in 2019, the Orbs Network has been growing through a variety of efforts by the entire community, including: the token distribution event, listing on exchanges, the continued growth of the PoS universe, partnerships with enterprise businesses, DeFi integration with multi chain support, etc. To help easily understand the current state of the project, the Orbs core team  has  sorted out some of what has been accomplished  over the last 2 years during this journey by the numbers. Some of these numbers are very interesting to us and some may be interesting to community members as well.

Here it is!
