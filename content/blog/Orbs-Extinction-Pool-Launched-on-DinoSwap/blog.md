**DinoSwap has announced the launch of the Orbs Extinction Pool!

The Orbs Extinction Pool on DinoSwap enables users to earn ORBS tokens rewards by staking DINO tokens.

We are very excited about this special integration with DinoSwap as it is expected to strengthen the ties of Orbs to the Polygon DeFi ecosystem, increase ORBS liquidity, and also increase exposure of the Orbs project to the Polygon user-base.



### What are Fossil Farms and Extinction Pools?

DinoSwap interfaces directly with third party AMM liquidity pools on Polygon such as QuickSwap and SushiSwap. 

The Orbs Extinction Pools mechanism works as follows:

1. Add liquidity to the ORBS-USDC pool on [QuickSwap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap) to receive ORBS-USDC LP tokens. Learn [here](https://www.orbs.com/orbs-is-now-live-on-quickswap/) how to add liquidity for the  ORBS-USDC pool on QuickSwap.
2. Stake the LP tokens in DinoSwap’s Fossil-Farms to earn DINO tokens in a process called “Excavation”. 
3. These DINO tokens can then be used in the Orbs Extinction Pool to earn ORBS tokens.

You can read more about Fossil Farms and Extinction Pools in DinoSwap’s [documentation](https://docs.dinoswap.exchange/).



### How to Participate?

In order to participate in the Orbs Extinction Pool on DinoSwap, you will need to have your ORBS tokens on the Polygon network. 

For most, this means migrating your Orbs tokens from the Ethereum network into Polygon. Luckily, this can be done easily using the official Ethereum-Polygon cross-chain bridge developed by the Polygon project, which can be found in the following link:

You can find the bridged ORBS token contract on Polygon here:

As always, exercise caution when working with 3rd party technologies, educate yourself regarding the risks involved, and read all security audits.

### DinoSwap - The next evolution in DeFi

_Long before apes, dinos roamed the earth_

DinoSwap is a cross-chain infrastructure project that builds liquidity for layer-one blockchains, AMMs and partnering projects, launching on the Polygon network.

Token swaps on DinoSwap are a simple way to trade one token for another by utilizing the liquidity pools of Polygon's top Decentralized Exchanges. Upon launch, DinoSwap integrated exchange functionality with SushiSwap - one of the largest DEXs on Polygon, with more AMMs coming soon.

### About Orbs
 
Orbs is a public blockchain infrastructure designed for mass usage applications and close integration with EVM-based L1’s such as Ethereum and Binance SmartChain. Orbs blockchain stack provides developers a proper mix of performance, cost, security and ease of use.

The Orbs protocol is decentralized and executed by a public network of permissionless validators using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. The Orbs network has been live since March 2019, is powered by the Orbs Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Universe and is enabled by the ORBS token.

Due to this hybrid architecture, the Orbs Network can be integrated easily with Ethereum and BSC-based DeFi projects and provide a variety of tools to the DeFi space. Accordingly, the team is working hard to establish Orbs as one of the leading projects in the DeFi space.

Founded in 2017, Orbs is being developed by a dedicated team of more than 30 people out of Tel Aviv, Israel, London, UK, Singapore, Tokyo, Japan and Seoul, South Korea. Orbs was named Gartner’s “Cool Vendor in Blockchain Technology” for 2018.
