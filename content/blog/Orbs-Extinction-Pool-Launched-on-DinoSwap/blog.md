**DinoSwap has announced the launch of the Orbs Extinction Pool!

The Orbs Extinction Pool on DinoSwap enables users to earn ORBS tokens rewards by staking DINO tokens.

We are very excited about this special integration with DinoSwap as it is expected to strengthen the ties of Orbs to the Polygon DeFi ecosystem, increase ORBS liquidity, and also increase exposure of the Orbs project to the Polygon user-base.

The Orbs Extinction Pool campaign will last xxx days with a total of xxxM ORBS tokens available for farming.


### What are Fossil Farms and Extinction Pools?

DinoSwap interfaces directly with third party AMM liquidity pools on Polygon such as QuickSwap and SushiSwap. 

The Orbs Extinction Pools mechanism works as follows:

* Add liquidity to the ORBS-USDC pool on [QuickSwap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap) to receive ORBS-USDC LP tokens. Learn [here](https://www.orbs.com/orbs-is-now-live-on-quickswap/) how to add liquidity for the  ORBS-USDC pool on QuickSwap.
* Stake the LP tokens in DinoSwap’s Fossil-Farms to earn DINO tokens in a process called “Excavation”. 
* These DINO tokens can then be used in the Orbs Extinction Pool to earn ORBS tokens.

You can read more about Fossil Farms and Extinction Pools in DinoSwap’s [documentation](https://docs.dinoswap.exchange/).



### How to Participate?

In order to participate in the Orbs Extinction Pool on DinoSwap, you will need to have your ORBS tokens on the Polygon network. 

For most, this means migrating your Orbs tokens from the Ethereum network into Polygon. Luckily, this can be done easily using the official Ethereum-Polygon cross-chain bridge developed by the Polygon project, which can be found in the following link:

You can find the bridged ORBS token contract on Polygon here:

As always, exercise caution when working with 3rd party technologies, educate yourself regarding the risks involved, and read all security audits.

### DinoSwap - The next evolution in DeFi

_Long before apes, dinos roamed the earth_

DinoSwap is a cross-chain infrastructure project that builds liquidity for layer-one blockchains, AMMs and partnering projects, launching on the Polygon network.

Token swaps on DinoSwap are a simple way to trade one token for another by utilizing the liquidity pools of Polygon's top Decentralized Exchanges. Upon launch, DinoSwap integrated exchange functionality with SushiSwap - one of the largest DEXs on Polygon, with more AMMs coming soon.
