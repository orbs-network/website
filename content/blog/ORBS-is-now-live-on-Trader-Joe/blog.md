**We are excited to announce that the ORBS token is now available on [Trader Joe](https://www.traderjoexyz.com/#/home), the leading DEX-AMM on the Avalanche network!**

Trader Joe is the biggest trading platform on Avalanche, with just under $3.5bn in total locked value (TVL) and over $100M in average daily trading volume.

In a [recent](https://www.orbs.com/AnySwap-Avalanche/) post we announced that the ORBS token is now available on Avalanche using the [AnySwap](https://anyswap.exchange/#/bridge) cross-chain bridge between Ethereum, BSC and Avalanche. Soon after, the Orbs token address was [whitelisted](https://www.orbs.com/ORBS-is-now-live-on-AvaScan/) on AvaScan, the leading Avalanche block explorer.

**Following these successful integrations, Avalanche users can now swap and add liquidity to Orbs pools on Trader Joe!**


### Before you Start

As always, before embarking onto a new chain, there are several things you need to do:

**1) Set up an Avalanche compatible wallet:** If youâ€™re using the Metamask wallet, here is a [quick guide](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/4626956-how-do-i-set-up-metamask-on-avalanche) on how to configure Metamask for Avalanche.

**2) Choose a cross-chain bridge:** You may use the AnySwap bridge as described in our recent [blog post](https://www.orbs.com/AnySwap-Avalanche/) on the subject.

**3) Fund your Avalanche wallet with AVAX tokens:** You can now bridge ORBS tokens into your Avalanche wallet. In addition, make sure to send some AVAX tokens. AVAX is the native token on the Avalanche network used to pay transaction fees. 

You are now ready to use Trader Joe on Avalanche!

As always, exercise caution when working with 3rd party technologies, educate yourself regarding the risks involved, and read all security audits.

### Trader Joe: A One-stop Decentralized Shop

Trader Joe is a one-stop decentralized trading platform on the Avalanche network, combining DEX services, DeFi lending and leveraged trading. 

Trader Joe already has an ORBS-AVAX pool set up with approx. $100,000 in total liquidity. Orbs users can now swap ORBS tokens as well as add liquidity to the Orbs pool!

Using Trader Joe is easy and user-friendly, very similar to most big DEX-AMM platforms on other chains. In case you are less familiar with how to use a DEX, here are the Trader Joe tutorials for [swapping](https://docs.traderjoexyz.com/main/exchange/trading-tutorial) and [adding liquidity](https://docs.traderjoexyz.com/main/exchange/liquidity-pool-tutorial) to pools.

When swapping Orbs, you may need to add the ORBS token to the token list by entering the [contract address](https://avascan.info/blockchain/c/token/0x340fE1D898ECCAad394e2ba0fC1F93d27c7b717A) in the search bar.

**The Avalanche network is one of the fastest growing DeFi ecosystems, offering a lot of untapped potential. Orbs is just getting started on Avalanche, more news to come soon!**
