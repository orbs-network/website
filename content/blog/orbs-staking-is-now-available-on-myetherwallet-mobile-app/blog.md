#### Orbs Staking is now available on MyEtherWallet (MEW)!

We are excited to announce that ORBS staking is now available on MEW mobile app for Android, using the mobile version of Orbs’ Tetra Wallet. This means that Orbs token holders can now stake their ORBS tokens directly from their MEW application.

### How to Stake ORBS Using the MEW Browser

The staking process is super-easy! All you need to do is navigate to the [Tetra webpage](https://staking.orbs.network/) from your MEW mobile app and stake your Orbs. Not sure how to use Tetra? Check out this simple [tutorial](/tetra-orbs-staking-wallet-tutorial).
