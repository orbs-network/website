**We are excited to announce that the ORBS token is now available on the Kyber Dynamic Market Maker (DMM)!**

Kyber Network recently [unveiled](https://blog.kyber.network/kyber-dmm-beta-is-live-b6bdd18d0dde) the mainnet beta release of their long-awaited Kyber Dynamic Market Maker (DMM) protocol, aimed to provide frictionless crypto liquidity with greater flexibility and extremely high capital efficiency.

The Kyber DMM can be up to 100x more capital efficient than typical AMMs by implementing the following novel features and advantages into its protocol:

1. Amplified pools with extremely high, if not the highest capital efficiency possible when compared to AMMs.
2. Lower trade slippage due to high capital efficiency.
3. Dynamic fees that adjust based on market conditions to optimize returns for liquidity providers and reduce the impact of impermanent loss.
4. No third-party or centralized oracle risks.
5. Fully permissionless and accessible, allowing anyone to deposit assets to earn fees and any user/Dapp/aggregator to swap assets or source for liquidity.
   All of the above, combined with a user-friendly interface and an [analytics & tracker page](https://info.dmm.exchange/), position the Kyber DMM as one of the fastest-growing DeFi projects in the ecosystem. For more information on Kyber DMM, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xgboyu7rss&feature=youtu.be).

### Swapping and Adding Liquidity to the Orbs Pools

[Swapping](https://dmm.exchange/#/swap) Orbs on the Kyber DMM is extremely easy: simply choose the Orbs token from the token selection list – you will find it in the default list of tokens provided in the user interface.

In addition, anyone can create a new Orbs pool or add liquidity to an existing pool. The [process](https://docs.dmm.exchange/guides/adding-liquidity/index.html) is intuitive and fully open & permissionless.

One important detail to take note of is the amplification factor (amp) which determines the virtual balances of the pool. An unamplified pool (amp = 1) covers an infinite price range, while higher amp factors can be used for better capital efficiency. Each pair can have multiple pools, with different amplification factors.
