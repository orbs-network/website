**We are happy to announce that ORBS staking is now available on the [ONTO Crypto Wallet](https://onto.app/en/) mobile app for Android, iOS and desktop!**

This means that Orbs token holders can now stake their ORBS tokens directly from their ONTO wallet application.


### Staking ORBS with ONTO

The staking process is very intuitive and easy. All you need to do is navigate to the [Tetra](https://staking.orbs.network/) (the official staking wallet of the Orbs project) webpage from your ONTO mobile app and stake your ORBS. 

Not sure how to use Tetra? Check out this simple [tutorial](https://www.orbs.com/tetra-orbs-staking-wallet-tutorial/).

Orbs has recently [released](https://www.orbs.com/PolygonStakingDate/) its PoS V3: Multi-chain staking on Ethereum and Polygon. ONTO wallet supports both the Ethereum and Polygon chains, which means that Orbs token holders can stake on either chain from the ONTO app.



### Multichain Support for the ORBS token

Another cool feature of the ONTO wallet is multi-chain asset support!

During the past year, the Orbs DeFi [ecosystem](https://www.orbs.com/ecosystem/) has consistently expanded, with integrations into 7 leading L1+L2 including: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, Harmony and Fantom.

ONTO multichain support enables ORBS token holders to keep their ORBS from 5 different chains in the same wallet. These include: Avalanche, Polygon, Harmony, BSC and Ethereum. Pretty awesome stuff!
