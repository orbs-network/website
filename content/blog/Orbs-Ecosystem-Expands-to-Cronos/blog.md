Orbs recently released its [“Orbs: A Re-introduction”](https://www.orbs.com/Orbs-A-Re-introduction/) blog post, where we outline Orbs’ role as a layer 3 infrastructure project in the next evolution of DeFi applications. To achieve this goal, a key component of the Orbs architecture is multi-chain interoperability.

The DeFi market is a dynamic and ever-evolving space, with new and exciting projects constantly popping up. The Orbs team is always looking for new opportunities and possibilities, which is why we're excited to announce the next steps for the Orbs ecosystem expansion...


### Cronos: A Rising Titan

[Cronos](https://cronos.org/) chain is one of the fastest growing blockchain infrastructure projects, [ranked #7](https://defillama.com/chains) by DeFi Llama, with over $1B in TVL.

Cronos chain is supported by [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) and is the first blockchain network that interoperates with both the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. It is an open-source, EVM-compatible chain that allows dApps to scale by offering key metrics such as: enhanced scalability, interoperability with other leading chains (such as Cosmos and crypto.org chain), secured PoA (proof-of-authority) consensus mechanism, and more…

In the past year, Cronos has made a major push into DeFi, recently announcing their [$100M grant program](https://blockworks.co/cronos-creates-100m-accelerator-program-to-support-defi-web3-projects/) attracting many DeFi projects. As a result, Cronos has managed to attract top-tier DeFi projects such as [VVS Finance](https://vvs.finance/), [MM FInance](https://mm.finance/), and [TECTONIC](https://tectonic.finance/), all with hundreds of millions in TVL and trading volumes.

### A Growing DeFi Ecosystem

Orbs is already available on leading L1+L2 chains, including: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, Harmony and Fantom. 

This further facilitated the integration of Orbs with over 30 of the major DeFi platforms and protocols (such as UniSwap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, Kyber Network, 1inch, Alpaca Finance, Beefy Finance, QuickSwap, Raydium, Trader Joe, Pangolin, SpookySwap, with more to come in the near future...).

Orbs' strategic expansion into the Cronos ecosystem will further solidify the ORBS token's status as a multi-chain asset which is integrated into all the major DeFi chains. In addition, it will open the door for more opportunities for collaborations with top Cronos-native DeFi protocols to showcase Orbs’ L3 capabilities.

Expect more news on Orbs and Cronos soon...
