Kodiak Finance, Berachain’s native liquidity platform, has integrated dTWAP and dLIMIT protocols powered by Orbs, bringing advanced order types natively to the Berachain ecosystem. This integration further cements Orbs as the go to solution for DEXs seeking to offer professional grade order functionality.

With this upgrade, traders can now lock in target prices using dLIMIT orders or split large trades over time via dTWAP, minimizing slippage and market impact.

Powered by Orbs’ Layer-3 infrastructure, this deployment builds on successful integrations across leading DEXs and networks, reinforcing Orbs’ position as the industry standard for advanced on-chain order types that every modern DEX should provide.

_Orbs operates as a decentralized protocol managed by a public network of permissionless validators using PoS, with tens of millions of dollars staked in TVL. The protocol enhances on-chain trading with L3 use cases like aggregated liquidity, advanced trading orders, and decentralized derivatives, bringing an efficient CeFi-like trading experience to DeFi._

### Trade with CeFi-level execution on a DEX

A Limit order allows users to buy or sell tokens at a specific price. While the specified price is guaranteed, the execution of the order is not, and depends on market movement. Limit orders will only be executed if the market price meets the order specifications.

A TWAP or DCA order, in the case of Kodiak Finance (Time-Weighted Average Price) order is a trading strategy that aims to reduce the impact of executing a large order all at once by breaking it down into smaller portions over a set time period. This approach helps minimize price volatility, allowing traders to acquire or sell assets gradually. In cryptocurrency, where prices can shift rapidly, TWAP strategies are particularly effective in reducing slippage and achieving more consistent execution.


**Kodiak Finance traders can now utilize these key traditional finance orders without sacrificing decentralization.** 


### Setting up dLIMIT and dTWAP orders


When switching to a dLIMIT ‘swap’ on Kodiak Finance, users are presented with an easy-to-follow user interface, along with an order history tab to track previous transactions. 

Before executing a dLIMIT order, traders must specify the following: 

1. **From:** The token that they currently have.
2. **To:** The token that they wish to swap for.
3. **Limit price:** Trades will ONLY be executed when the available market price is equal to or better than the Limit price.

dLIMIT takes into account current market conditions, prices, and gas fees. Once the parameters are set, the user can approve the specific source token, place the order, and review their order live in the ‘order history’ tab.

For a dTWAP order, three additional parameters need to be specified:

- **No. of Intervals:** allows the user to specify the number of individual trades. The UI automatically calculates the total number of transactions required to complete the entire order and the estimated trading interval.
- **Trade Intervals:** sets the time gap between each individual trade. The user can edit this parameter, which also results in changes to the corresponding trade size and number parameters.

Similarly to dLIMIT, these parameters offer incredible flexibility in customizing each order, taking into account factors such as market conditions and current gas fees. Additionally, the UI facilitates both dTWAP-market orders, which execute all trades at the available market price, and dTWAP-Limit orders, which only execute individual trades if they are within the price Limit set by the user. Once these parameters are set, the user can approve the specific source token, place the order, and confirm the user-specified configuration.

### The Standard for Advanced Orders on Decentralized Exchanges

The dLIMIT & dTWAP protocols, powered by Orbs [L3 technology](https://www.orbs.com/overview/), have become the industry standard for decentralized algorithmic orders in DeFi. The ‘powered by Orbs’ branding has become a staple of confidence when executing advanced orders on decentralized venues.

Together with other L3-powered protocols, [Liquidity Hub](https://www.orbs.com/liquidity-hub/) for aggregated liquidity and [Perpetual Hub](https://www.orbs.com/perpetual-hub/) for decentralized on-chain perpetual futures.
