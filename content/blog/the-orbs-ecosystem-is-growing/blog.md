The last couple of months saw a substantial expansion in the Orbs ecosystem!

During this period we have seen a significant increase of interest in the Orbs project by various players in the crypto market, such as staking, for example. In addition, the Orbs team has been working hard on integrating Orbs into major platforms and tools, such as AWS, MS Azure, and Google Cloud for example, in order to make the Orbs project more accessible to developers and stakeholders.

Here are just a few examples of the recent announcements:

## Greater Focus on DeFi

In the past couple of months, the Orbs project has been pushing hard into the DeFi space, with the biggest step so far being the announcement of the Liquidity Nexus, Orbs’ newest DeFi project, aiming to enable single-sided yield farming on leading venues.

The Orbs Liquidity Nexus creates a pathway for CeFi-sourced liquidity to enter DeFi by matching their capital denominated in stablecoins to that of crypto natives denominated in more volatile cryptocurrencies, and combining those to engage in yield farming strategies that neither would be able to access on their own.

This project, and other similar ideas that could be developed on Orbs, have the potential to solve many of the obstacles currently facing the broader world of DeFi as it expands, while also bringing significant value and usage to the Orbs Network itself.
