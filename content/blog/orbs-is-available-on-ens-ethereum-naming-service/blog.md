The Orbs team is excited to announce that Orbs is now available on the [ENS protocol](https://ens.domains/): the most widely integrated blockchain naming standard on Ethereum.

This puts Orbs in line with other major projects such as Metamask, Uniswap and Chainlink, which rely on ENS for secure naming. You may have seen [uniswap.eth..](https://app.ens.domains/name/uniswap.eth). well now you can also find [token.orbs.eth](https://etherscan.io/enslookup-search?search=staking.orbs.eth)!

ENS allows the Orbs project to name the Orbs Universe smart contract addresses on Ethereum for a more secure, more convenient and user-friendly interaction. Having a naming convention and readable addresses is an important step to help developers integrate with the Orbs project, increase adoption for less tech-oriented users, and avoid mistakes when entering an address.

Orbs is proud to be a decentralized, open project where anyone can develop on the Orbs network and audit the protocol. Integration with ENS is an important step towards that goal.

The Orbs R&D team has made sure all major contracts and addresses associated with the Orbs project now appear on ENS. The team is working on expanding this service to additional parts of the Orbs protocol, as well as adding additional ENS features such as profile information and text records.

One of the coolest features of this integration is the ability to reach every official Orbs Guardian securely with an easy-to-remember name. Instead of remembering cumbersome hex addresses, the first Guardian for example is now accessible through the name:

0.committee.orbs.eth
