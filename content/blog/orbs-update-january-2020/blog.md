##### **_Message from Orbs Korea Community Head, Eddy Kim:_**

_Welcome back to our monthly recap everyone! Our Community was delighted to receive this Greeting message from Orbs TLV HQ! New Years’ online event is ongoing now, please visit [https://orbskorea.net](https://orbskorea.net) to send your wishes to Orbs :)_

https://youtu.be/oK2S1b1Sj14

_2020 will be a great year for the Korean presence too: The Korean team is frequenting many meetings with several conglomerates to discuss the usage of blockchain for scaled use-cases. It is important that we maintain strong relationships with these industry giants._

_While we already have a thriving Kakao chat group; the KR team built another community forum to facilitate productive discussion in non-volatile environments. Almost all information in the Korean language will be integrated into the forum._

_In Korea, there will be a parliamentary election in April, so fake news is an increasingly emerging issue. If you can read Korean, don’t miss the post on [How Blockchain Helps Solve Fake News Problems](https://link.medium.com/aemYg60yB3)._

_At last, a new POS app is coming soon! This app is mainly developed by the Korean team and will support the local language. We hope this will increase accessibility to the POS universe. Stay tuned for the app-launching!_

_**새해 복 많이 받으세요,**_

In early December, the Orbs team co-organized a meetup with the co-founder of LinkedIn, Eric Ly as part of the Crypto Monday event. Eric co-founded a new blockchain company named [Hub](https://joinhub.com/).

The Orbs project got nice exposure to audiences both at the event, before and after it within different social media platforms. Later this month we were fortunate to speak and present the Orbs project in two great conferences:

[Edge computing](https://www.edgecomputingworld.com/agenda/) - Took place in Silicon Valley on December 9th as part of a fireside chat with Hedera Hashgraph, Talking about the difference and comparing some of the similarities in our approach to the market.

The second conference named [Elev8](https://www.elev8con.com/agenda/) was held in Vegas on December 9th, this time I was part of a panel called “What Blockchain Business Models are Working and Why?”

There were 3 other panelists:

Emma Liu (Tigergraph),  Mark Friedler (Anheuser-Busch InBev, Gigex), Zane Witherspoon (Dispatch Labs). Orbs represented different approaches and parts of the industry. This panel attracted great interest from the audience given the diversity of opinions shared.

## Media highlights

##### _"Public blockchain can restore this trust; a company can state what data is shared, then PROVE it through a neutral 3rd party. This keeps data private while providing a greater guarantee than today's black box."_

From Tal Kol new byline featured on Secure Info Watch: [**Why blockchain is the necessary safeguard against data breaches**](https://www.securityinfowatch.com/cybersecurity/article/21122947/why-blockchain-is-the-necessary-safeguard-against-data-breaches)**.**

##### _“Crypto startup Orbs has proposed a blockchain-driven system to trim unnecessary government spending while also cutting down on food stamp fraud.”_

##### _"The administrative and bureaucratic costs alone for SNAP are enormous -- $5B just to administer $60B to citizens. Cutting 20% of that bureaucratic cost is huge!"_
