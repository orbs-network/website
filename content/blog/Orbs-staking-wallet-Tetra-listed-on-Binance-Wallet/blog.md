**Exciting news for the Orbs community: TETRA, the official Orbs staking wallet, is now featured in the dApp directory of the Binance Web3 Wallet. This addition places TETRA inside the Binance mobile app, giving every ORBS holder a direct path to staking without extra downloads or extensions.**

Open the Binance app, create or connect a Web3 wallet, tap on TETRA in the dApp list, and start staking within moments. All staking is carried out on chain, so you retain full self-custody of your tokens while benefiting from the familiar Binance interface and robust security standards.


_Orbs operates as a decentralized protocol managed by a public network of permissionless validators using PoS, with tens of millions of dollars staked in TVL. The protocol enhances on-chain trading with L3 use cases like aggregated liquidity, advanced trading orders, and decentralized derivatives, bringing an efficient CeFi-like trading experience to DeFi._


### Keyless wallet


Users need a wallet to explore DeFi and participate in proof-of-stake networks. Although many options exist, some people still steer clear of Web3 wallets because they worry about technical hurdles and hacking risk. Major centralized exchanges such as Binance and OKX now address those fears by directly integrating “keyless” wallets into their apps.

Keyless wallets offer the following benefits:

- **No private key storage:** users never handle a seed phrase; key management is distributed with MPC or abstracted with ZK.
- **Simple recovery:** a lost wallet can be restored with email, biometrics, or a trusted device instead of a long recovery phrase.
- **Enhanced security:** removing a single point of failure limits exposure to hacking, phishing, and accidental key loss.
- **Beginner-friendly, Web2 style experience:** sign-up and login feel familiar, similar to Google or Apple authentication, lowering the barrier for newcomers to Web3.


### Staking Orbs using Binance Wallet

Getting started with the Binance Web3 Wallet could not be easier. Simply log in with a Binance account that has completed KYC, install the latest Binance mobile app, and follow the prompts inside the app to create your Web3 wallet. As soon as the wallet is set up, you can stake your ORBS tokens in a few taps. For a full walkthrough, watch the tutorial video below.
