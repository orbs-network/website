**We are excited to announce the new Orbs website promotion campaign!**

We recently [announced](https://www.orbs.com/orbs-website-launch/) the launch of the new [Orbs website](https://orbs-network.github.io/website/). As you might have noticed, the homepage has an AWESOME new design of rotating globe with pop-up cards, each showing a different element of the Orbs network such as Orbs Guardians, Contributors, and more.

However, there is one important element of the Orbs network that is still missing…
the Orbs Delegators of course!

Delegators are ORBS token holders who assign their voting weight (stake) to Guardians, empowering them to maintain security and uphold  the ecosystem. They make up an essential part of the Orbs network and as such, deserve a special place in the new website.
