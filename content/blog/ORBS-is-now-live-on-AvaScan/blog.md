**We are excited to announce that the ORBS token is now available on [AvaScan](https://avascan.info/), the leading Avalanche block explorer!**

AvaScan is the leading block explorer for the Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain, allowing users to easily lookup, confirm and validate transactions that have taken place on Avalanche, similar to how [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) is used for the Ethereum Network.

In a [recent](https://www.orbs.com/AnySwap-Avalanche/) post we announced that the ORBS token is now available on Avalanche using the [AnySwap](https://anyswap.exchange/#/bridge) cross-chain bridge between Ethereum, BSC and Avalanche. Following that successful integration, Orbs is now officially part of the Avalanche ecosystem. 

**As a result, Orbs can now be tracked on the Avalanche blockchain using the AvaScan explorer!**


### Orbs Contract on Avalanche

The official ORBS token contract address on Avalanche is:
[https://avascan.info/blockchain/c/token/0x340fE1D898ECCAad394e2ba0fC1F93d27c7b717A](https://avascan.info/blockchain/c/token/0x340fE1D898ECCAad394e2ba0fC1F93d27c7b717A)

**Always verify the token address before making a transaction.

With this latest integration, Orbs is now live on all 5 major L-1 chains: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Solana, and now - Avalanche, as well as over 17 of the leading DeFi protocols.

**With the recent [accelerated growth](https://www.orbs.com/orbs-ecosystem-expansion-whats-next/) of the Orbs ecosystem in the DeFi space, the Orbs team is ready for the next evolution of the project! 

Orbs unique features designed for interoperability primarily with EVM-compatible blockchains, together with its decentralized network of nodes, gives it a competitive advantage in various DeFi applications.

We are calling all developers seeking to optimize their DeFi protocols to explore the [Orbs Ecosystem Grant Program](https://www.orbs.com/The-Orbs-Ecosystem-Grant-Program-Second-Call-for-Grants/), which focuses on harnessing the power of the Orbs Universe to gain an edge in DeFi applications.

We are very excited about  tapping the potential of Orbs in the DeFi space. Already we are seeing applications of amazing innovative projects being developed on Orbs. 

**More exciting news to come soon!**
