PancakeSwap [recently](/orbs-launches-a-syrup-pool-on-pancakeswap) launched the Orbs Syrup Pool on BSC.

Soon after, Alpaca Finance [announced](/orbs-added-to-alpaca-finance-vaults) that they are adding Orbs to their farming pools!

Alpaca Finance is one of the most innovative DeFi projects on Binance Smart Chain. As of today, it is the largest lending protocol allowing leveraged yield farming on BSC. In this new initiative, Orbs holders will be able to increase their yields by using the Grazing Range and Leveraged Farming features offered by Alpaca.

### 1) Add Liquidity to the ORBS-BUSD Farm

Go to the FARM tab and choose the ORBS-BUSD farm.

Enter quantities for each token and set the leverage which can vary from x1️ (no leverage) to x2 (maximum leverage). In order to use leverage, you will need to borrow BUSD. Alpaca will balance out the pair weights to provide liquidity at a 50:50 ratio.

When opening a leveraged farm, you are eligible to earn **ALPACA tokens.**

Once the position is opened, you can always re-adjust the parameters:

### 2) Lend ALPACA tokens

Next, you can deposit the ALPACA tokens in step 1 in the LEND tab, to receive **ibALPACA tokens**. These tokens will be deposited in the Alpaca lending vaults and are then offered to yield farmers for leveraging up their positions.

### 3) Earn Orbs in the Grazing Range

In the [Grazing Range](https://app.alpacafinance.org/grazing-rangeimg) tab, you will be able to stake the ibALPACA in order to earn ORBS tokens.
