Popular crypto wallet MetaMask recently [announced](https://medium.com/metamask/introducing-metamask-swaps-84318c643785) that its users can now swap tokens directly from their MetaMask wallet. The cool feature is that MetaMask will in fact aggregate data from multiple sources such as popular DEXs, to ensure MetaMask users always get the best price with the lowest network fees.

This means that ORBS, the official token of the Orbs network, being listed on major DEXs such as [Balancer](https://blog.orbsdefi.com/p/orbsusdc-liquidity-pool-now-on-balancer) and [Uniswap](https://blog.orbsdefi.com/p/orbs-on-uniswap-and-whats-next), can now be swapped on the Metamask wallet!

Follow this short demo video to swap the ORBS token on your MetaMask wallet:

## But What About Staking?

Now here is the exciting part, not only can you swap ORBS tokens on MetaMask, you can now stake them as well on the MetaMask mobile app!

**Tetra, the official staking wallet of the Orbs project is now connected to MetaMask.**

This means that Orbs token holders can now stake their Orbs tokens directly from their MetaMask application. This is available for both Android and iOS mobile apps, as well as for desktop.

Again, the staking process is super-easy. All you need to do is navigate to the [Tetra webpage](https://staking.orbs.network/) from your MetaMask mobile app and stake your Orbs. Not sure how to use Tetra? Check out this simple [tutorial](https://www.orbs.com/tetra-orbs-staking-wallet-tutorial/).

Here is a short demo video for staking from your MetaMask mobile app:

The bottom line is that MetaMask can now be used as a “one-stop shop” for holding, swapping, and staking your ORBS wallet.

The Orbs team is working hard to ensure that participating in the Orbs Universe is as user-friendly and accessible as possible for the ORBS token holders. Connecting Tetra is an important step towards that goal.
