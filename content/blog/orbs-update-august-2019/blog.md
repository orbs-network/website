...

**Welcome back to Orbs‚Äô monthly update, folks!** The goal of this post is to give you a general idea as to what has been happening at Orbs HQ while you were busy. July was a month marked by strong partnerships and milestones for the network. Here are some highlights:

## Orbs with Celsius, BitGo, and Staked!

As reported at the end of the month, ORBS has been added to Celsius‚Äô wallet, allowing their 30,000 users to stake the token as part of Orbs‚Äô proof of stake universe. This partnership is particularly exciting as it grants thousands of Celsius‚Äô users with unprecedented access to the Orbs network.

Another entity, the popular crypto custodian [BitGo](https://www.bitgo.com/) (aka [The $1 TRILLION Wallet](https://www.coindesk.com/the-1-trillion-wallet-bitgos-bid-to-bring-bitcoin-to-wall-street-and-beyond)) is adding ORBS support to its crypto wallet following talks between the two blockchain companies.

In addition to these collaborations, all part of a wider push to make the network as accessible and secure as possible, SaaS vendor [Staked.US](https://staked.us/) has chosen to join the party, adding ORBS as well by acting as a Guardian to the Orbs Network! You can read a bit more about the nature of the partnership, as well as the Seoul meetup celebrating it, [in my blog post](https://www.orbs.com/celsius-bitgo-staked-join-orbs-universe).

## Full custody support for ORBS on Coinbase Custody

## News from the Foundation

_This segment was contributed by Netta Korin of_ [_The Hexa Foundation_](https://www.hexa.org/)

#### Hexa Foundation was invited to Bahrain!

_I was part of a very select group of business leaders invited to attend the_ [_Peace to Prosperity Workshop_](https://english.alarabiya.net/en/business/economy/2019/06/25/US-led-workshop-kicks-off-in-Bahrain-with-top-business-people-government-officials.html) _in Bahrain, specifically due to blockchain projects in our region which the Hexa Foundation is working on for the last year. It was a great honor to be part of such an effort and to discuss blockchain ideas within a group of world land business leaders. The Hexa Foundation‚Äôs goal is blockchain for social impact and we focus on education, research, and special projects._

_Some of the people we met and discussed blockchain ideas within Bahrain include Ambassador Josette Sheeran, Abe Goldschmidt and Will Doffermyre of Oversea Private Investment Corporation of the US Govt Participation in GBBC Round Table at the U.S. Senate._

#### Hexa Foundation in US Congress!

_Ran Hammer, Adv. was sent to represent the Hexa Foundation \[and Orbs\] at a first of its kind legislative roundtable at the U.S. Senate, discussing the state of blockchain technology and digital assets in the United States. The event was organized by the Global Blockchain Business Council and the Consumer Technology Association. Participants included members of Congress (including Darren Soto (FL-09), David Schweikert (AZ-6), Trey Hollingsworth (IN-09), Bill Foster (IL-11) and Warren Davidson (OH-08), Clyde Vanel of the NY State Assembly, as well as representatives from governmental authorities and municipalities, leading law and consulting firms as well as dominant market leaders._

_The timing of the event was great, as it was conducted a day after the two congressional hearings conducted on the matter of the Facebook-led cryptocurrency project, Libra, which received a lot of attention. This week will surely_ _be remembered as the week during which cryptocurrency and blockchain technology hit DC straight on. We were very happy that the discussion was focused on the actual benefits and positive social impact blockchain technology can promote and the means to improve education about and achieve adoption for this ground-breaking technology._

_During the discussion we were able to convey two of the major ideas we have been advocating over the last year ‚Äì (i) use of blockchain technology as a means to generate digital trust at scale; and (ii) our vision for appropriate regulatory regime to govern the sale, use, and promotion of token-based products and services._

_The lawmakers and other participants were very receptive to our ideas and we plan to follow up on our participation with additional discussions based on the connections we made in DC._

## GLF Update

_This segment was contributed by_ [_@assaf_bielski_](https://community.orbs.network/u/assaf_bielski/summary)

_On 23-25 of July,_ [_@jnoam_](https://community.orbs.network/u/jnoam/) _and I participated in the first out of four GLF workshops in London. In attendance were some of the largest telecom operators globally, including AT&T, Verizon, Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Telefonica, and Telstra. There were also several vendors from the telecom and blockchain sectors, including IMB, Consensys, and Corda. The goal of the workshops is to create a blockchain-based reference architecture for global interoperability in the telecom industry._

_As we have a seat at a major industry initiative, our role is to push for an architecture that is open to public blockchain and work with some of the other partners on proof-of-concept projects, based on the GLF guidelines. The first phase of this work should be completed by the end of October 2019, and we will update you on the progress!_

## Tech highlights

#### Node upgrade

New node upgrade includes several mini-features and improvements based on requirements gathered from:

- Insights regarding the Orbs production network operating since March 2019
- Insights from elections processing
- Insights from an internal hackathon, which was focused on application development on the Orbs platform

Normally this news would be relegated to a separate R&D post (coming next week!), but the Orbs core team is very excited to publish the first version that is not a hot-fix and contains actual features.

You can read more about the node upgrade [in Noam‚Äôs post](https://www.orbs.com/node-upgrade-version-1-1-1/).

**Be sure to stay tuned for next week‚Äôs upcoming R&D update which will dive deeper into the ongoing developments behind Orbs‚Äô open-source infrastructure!**

...

Before I sign off, I want to remind our readers that in September, [Ethereal Summit is coming to Tel Aviv](https://www.etherealsummit.com/), and Orbs is sponsoring! If you plan to attend the conference, be sure to reach out on Orbs‚Äô own turf :) Attended by Ethereum‚Äôs own Vitalik Buterin, this summit should be quite fun and interesting.

Of course, as with any events attended by Orbs‚Äô representatives, you are invited and encouraged to come to meet us and introduce yourself!

**Stay tuned for the upcoming R&D update and more exciting developments from Orbs soon. Y**ou can also reach out to me personally at [nate@orbs.com](mailto:nate@orbs.com) with any comments or questions; I will do my best to get an answer for you.
