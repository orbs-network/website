**SpookySwap users can now farm BOO tokens on the ORBS-USDC pool and earn ORBS tokens in SpookySwap’s Single-stake feature!**

After [recently](https://www.orbs.com/ORBS-is-now-live-on-SpookySwap/) adding the Orbs tokens to their platform, SpookySwap are now launching farming and Single-stake for $ORBS. Users can now farm SpookySwap’s native token, BOO, by providing liquidity to the ORBS-USDC pool which can then be staked to earn ORBS tokens.

The launch of ORBS farming and staking by SpookySwap, the biggest DEX-AMM on the Fantom network, is another important step to solidify the awareness of the Orbs token to new market participants on Fantom.

Be sure to check out our blog post on how to [bridge](https://www.orbs.com/Multichain/) ORBS onto Fantom, in order to be able to participate in Orbs farming and staking on SpookySwap.

 
### Let’s Get Spooky With It

Participating in the Orbs farming and single-stake pool on SpookySwap is very intuitive and user friendly. The whole process can be summarized in the following flow:

➡️ Buy/Farm BOO tokens

➡️ Stake BOO in xBOO/buyback pool, receive xBOO as receipt

➡️ Stake xBOO in the Orbs single-stake pool to earn ORBS tokens

 
And here it is in a bit more detail…
 
 
### Orbs Liquidity Farming

Orbs token holders can earn BOO tokens by [adding liquidity](https://docs.spooky.fi/products/liquidity-pools) to the ORBS-USDC pool on Spooky. By adding liquidity you will receive spLP (Spooky Liquidity Pair) tokens, which is a representation of your ownership of the pool.

Users can then Deposit their spLP tokens in the Orbs farm to participate in [liquidity mining](https://docs.spooky.fi/products/liquidity-farm) and earn BOO rewards.

### Orbs Single-stake Pool

Spooky’s [Single-stake](https://spooky.fi/#/pools) feature enables users to stake their BOO tokens in order to receive xBOO and earn ORBS without the risk of impermanent loss.

Using Single-staking is very easy and user-friendly. Here is a short [tutorial](https://docs.spooky.fi/products/single-stake-farm) by SpookySwap on how to use this feature.

And that’s it! You can now farm and earn Orbs on SpookySwap!

Orbs is currently one of only 6 other tokens which have been added to SpookySwap’s single-sided staking pools. This is a great vote of confidence by Spooky in the Orbs project!

**About SpookySwap**

[SpookySwap](https://www.spooky.fi/) is the top native decentralized exchange for the Fantom Opera network. Spooky has brought new capabilities to ETH-alternative networks such as being the first DEX to implement native limit orders outside of Ethereum and the first DEX to implement a bridge built into the interface. SpookySwap is fully decentralized with governance by BOO being used to determine all new farms, single-stake pools, and farm weight adjustments. Spooky’s commitment to improving user experience and DeFi utility for Fantom resulted in a top protocol on Fantom Opera by both TVL and volume.
