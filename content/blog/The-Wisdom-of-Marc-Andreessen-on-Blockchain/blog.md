I recently came across Marc Andreessen’s [article](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-bitcoin-matters/) from 2014 on Bitcoin. In many ways it is visionary (no surprise). I have been in the industry for four years now, with most of my focus being on the social impact of blockchain. It is astonishing to me that, in 2014, before there was any institutional presence in Bitcoin, or indeed a popular understanding of this new technology, Andreessen was able to outline its potential economic and social impact for the future.  Eight years after he inked his words, I would like to address one of the topics from his article - micropayments. I will explore how blockchain could help transform micropayments and thus enable not only monetization of certain aspects of businesses that are in need of a solution, but also could assist the weakest links in its society.

Micropayments are not a new concept. Since the mid 1990s micropayments have experienced various degrees of popularity. By definition micropayments are transactions with a value smaller than a certain threshold. Importantly, below that threshold, the transaction fee incurred becomes a significant portion of the total transaction value, and consequently not economical. Another important aspect is that due to the miniscule monetary amounts, micropayments refer only to digital transactions of non-tangible goods. Any additional cost of handling and shipping might mean a hundredfold increase of the original transaction value, making it utterly irrelevant. 

Credit card companies offer merchants various types of price plans for the fees they charge. These plans usually comprise a lump sum charged per transaction and a portion charged out of it. Not surprisingly, this information is not openly available from the card companies themselves, rather by [others who compare these rates](https://www.merchantmaverick.com/the-complete-guide-to-credit-card-processing-rates-and-fees/) as their service for merchants. Within that context, let us examine what would be the fee that a merchant is charged for a micropayment. 

We assume the following:

- The lowest fee we uncovered was 1.29% of the transaction value, no lump sum fee charged.

- Since the smallest building block of (most) FIAT currencies is 1/100 of the whole, i.e. a cent, this would be the minimal fee the credit card company charges, regardless if it is higher than 1.29%.

Charting the proportion of the transaction fee as a function of the transaction value, we receive the image below. For example, a $0.01 transaction incurs a fee of 100%, while the fee of a $0.10 transaction is “only” 10%. Naturally this goes to show the irrationality of carrying out micropayment transactions under these payment platforms.

However, now, there is an alternative. Blockchain provides the perfect solution for micropayments, for many reasons. It is a digital form of payment that is getting faster by the day, and importantly, the minimal payment unit of both Bitcoin and Ethereum are incredibly small as displayed in the table below:

In addition, crypto wallets are easily embedded in any digital device, whether mobile, laptop or any other IOT device. And, while on certain networks and on certain occasions, fees may greatly vary, in many protocols fees are not an issue and may reach as low as fractions of a cent. 

Last but certainly not least is user privacy. Due to blockchain’s asymmetric encryption, when paying, the payer exposes only her public address, which provides practically no information for someone who is looking to hack her wallets. Unfortunately the same does not go for a credit card transaction, which requires the payer to share her full credit card number and hope the payment platform is properly secured. 

Now that the technological aspect is covered, only one question remains - can I get anything for a millionth of a dollar? Well, I am not sure about a millionth, but there are many use cases for micropayments. Below are a few:

- **Alternative to the subscription model** - there is no point in reiterating the economic reasoning behind the subscription model for consuming online content and its success in recent years. Whether it is video content, music, newspapers etc. While there are multiple advantages to this model, it is far from being perfect and still has certain caveats. For instance, what if someone would only like to buy a single item rather than commit to a subscription? Let’s assume that Alice is subscribed to two online magazines, when she discovers an interesting article on a third one. She will not go for a third subscription, though she is willing to pay only for that article. From the magazine’s perspective, the article is already there, why not charge someone for it? Micropayments allow both Alice and the magazine to maximize their economic utility. 

- **Digital copyrights, royalties and referrals** - as with the previous case, there is no need to explain what copyrights, royalties or referrals are. Micropayments provide a relatively simple mechanism for the immediate settlements involved, with practically no minimal limit to the amount charged per each, unlike the complicated solutions that stand today.

- **IOT transactions** - this use case is highly visionary, though will probably become as mundane and trivial as a light switch, sooner rather than later. To date, IOT has barely matured into a fraction of its vast potential. One possible reason for this delay is the lack of a simple and easy to implement monetization model. Micropayments on blockchain could be the answer. Think of all the data that may be collected by your car, from road condition, to traffic and more. Sharing data collected by mass users in real time could be invaluable for traffic planning and road maintenance, and - as such - why not pay for it. The added value of blockchain, is an improved mechanism to anonymize the data and protect user privacy. Again, a winning combination. Naturally, this could work with any other IOT device, from smart meters to home appliances and more.

- **Social impact** - this is the most straightforward use case on this list (and obviously my favorite). Micropayments on blockchain can be revolutionary on two aspects. The first is that donation targets could easily set up accounts for receiving funds, which will allow donating directly to them, cutting all intermediaries and overhead costs. Having said that, it is critical to note that this feature is a double-edged sword that might turn out to be its major pitfall. It would be just as easy for fraudsters to set up false accounts, luring in donors. There will be a need for rating and auditing, similarly to current online services who rate charities on multiple criteria (e.g. [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org), [Smart Giving](https://www.smartgiving.ca), [Council of Nonprofits](https://www.councilofnonprofits.org), and others), in order to ensure and provide better visibility to donors. In addition, as a minimum donation amount will no longer be an issue, we may see donations of micro-amounts. The [World Bank](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/stories/the-classification-of-countries-by-income.html) categorizes a country whose gross national income per capita is lower than $1,025 as “low income”. Put differently, it means a daily salary that is lower than $3. As of 2020 data, there are [27 low income countries](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/the-world-by-income-and-region.html). Micropayments could provide an excellent mechanism, which must be carefully monitored for fraud, to donate funds to people in need in those countries. I think you can see how this, if managed well, could lead to more efficient giving, and a more direct impact.


Over the last few years, micropayments lost some of their initial prestige. While the concept was ahead of its time, the technology lagged behind and prevented it from materializing. Marc Andreessen was correct and revolutionary in highlighting the ability of blockchain to transform micropayments. Here, I barely scratched the surface in terms of the use cases and the potential. As the usage of digital wallets and cryptocurrencies becomes more abundant, new use cases for micropayments will be further explored and developed. Businesses could become more efficient and be able to monetize more of their offerings. Entire communities could be transformed or brought out of economic depression by direct and personal assistance without an intermediary. Kudos to Marc on his vision eight years back - blockchain could be the breath of fresh air the world was waiting for.
