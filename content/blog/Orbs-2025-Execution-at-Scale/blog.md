GM. 2025 was a year of large scale execution for Orbs. Across community growth, integrations, and revenue, the ecosystem continued to grow, with Orbs’ Layer-3 protocols remaining a core part of how partners (frens) operate in production. The year validated not only the demand for Orbs’ technology but also its reliability in real-world use across multiple chains, DEXs, and customized UIs, whether dTWAP is called as such or DCA.

Thank you to everyone who helped ensure 2025 was a success: contributors, guardians, delegators, community members, partners, and many others who added value where we might have otherwise missed it.

## Core Protocols in Production

While this year is more accurately defined as Orbs in production, it’s hard to ignore the whopping **32 new integrations** that have taken place this year, if you account for each chain. This has contributed to a total (annual) volume for dTWAP/dLIMIT to be **over $300M**, **Liquidity Hub over $210M**, and **Perpetual Hub over $4.6 Billion.** The bulk of these integrations were only possible due to the foundation laid over the past 2-3 years, both in terms of business relationships and what has become the DeFi standard that traders expect from DEXs.

Beyond deployment, operating protocols in production requires sustained support and adaptability. Throughout 2025, Orbs collaborated closely with integration partners to tailor implementations to their specific needs, incorporating customizable UI components and flexible configurations. Near-24/7 support enabled rapid issue resolution and coordinated upgrades without disrupting live environments. This approach strengthened long-term partner relationships, as evidenced by consistent positive feedback and repeat integrations across the ecosystem and new launches.

## Newcomers to the Stack

The first major addition to the stack in 2025 was Perpetual Hub Ultra, an evolution of what is now Perpetual Hub Legacy. The upgrade expanded the role of Orbs’ technology in enabling perpetual DEXs at scale. Orbs now provides front-end, hedger, liquidator infrastructure, and oracle services across seven DEXs. Notable integrations include QuickSwap on Base, a long-standing Orbs integrator, as well as several other in production deployments. The protocol still leverages the Symmio smart contract infrastructure, but Orbs infrastructure plays a larger role in the deployments and direction.

Later in the year, Orbs introduced dSLTP (decentralized stop-loss and take-profit), marking the first new protocol launch in nearly two years. dSLTP has already gone live with integrations on THENA and SpookySwap, with additional deployments underway. While launched toward the end of 2025, the protocol is positioned to scale further in 2026 as adoption continues.

## The Network

Since the launch of PoS V3, ORBS staking has reached an all-time high, recently surpassing the **1 billion ORBS milestone for the first time**. This growth reflects increasing validator participation and long-term holder conviction, reinforcing the economic security of the network at a time when Orbs infrastructure is operating at meaningful scale across DeFi. Higher stake concentration strengthens consensus guarantees and aligns incentives among token holders, validators, and protocols that rely on Orbs in production.

More broadly, this milestone signals a maturation of the Orbs ecosystem. As protocol usage grows and core infrastructure continues to prove itself under real market conditions, staking has become a clear expression of confidence in Orbs’ long-term roadmap. With PoS V3 providing a more robust and flexible foundation, rising stake levels position the network to support continued expansion.

## Events and Community

From Denver and London to Japan and South Korea, Orbs maintained a consistent global presence throughout 2025\. In the first half of the year, Orbs co-hosted Perps After Dark alongside close partners, followed by community meetups in Nagoya and Tokyo with global team members in attendance. The second half of the year continued with DeFi Night in Korea, DeFi N’ Chill in Argentina, and year-end Orbs community celebrations in Seoul. This was in addition to numerous industry events attended throughout the year without dedicated hosted events.

Orbs attended 15 conferences worldwide. In Seoul and Tokyo, where there’s a high concentration of Orbs community members and of crypto enthusiasts, we focused on deeper, local engagement. In Japan, we hosted monthly Orbs Cafés with speakers from SBI VC, CoinTrade, and JPYC. In Seoul, we ran several events throughout the year for both new and long-standing community members.

Furthermore, it was another strong year for media, with 250+ earned placements across top outlets such as Bitcoin.com, multiple Cointelegraph mentions and quotes, and podcasts, Twitter Spaces, and AMAs, alongside some of our largest integrations, including PancakeSwap and QuickSwap.

And yes, the merch deserves a mention. For the first time, Orbs distributed exclusive, high-quality swag to Guardians, influencers, and selected close partners. Whether it was bomber jackets or branded Patagonia bags, the initiative was well received and helped reinforce the relationships we’ve been building on the ground, and helped spread Orbs messaging in a meaningful way. We plan to continue it and have seen the impact in real time.

## More Than the Protocols

For the first time, Orbs held a company offsite in Italy, with the ENTIRE team in attendance. The gathering had been delayed multiple times and, at one point, fully canceled due to ongoing geopolitical realities, making the eventual offsite especially meaningful. Beyond reconnecting in person, the time together focused on alignment across teams, clarifying priorities, and strengthening the collaboration required to operate and support production infrastructure at scale.

## Onward

Looking ahead to 2026, the focus is on building from what’s already live. With a growing set of protocols and long-term partners, Orbs will continue to deepen integrations, support teams as they scale, and bring Layer-3 infrastructure to places where it’s already proving useful in practice.

In addition, 2025 marked an important step toward greater community involvement with the announcement of the Orbs DAO during Korea Blockchain Week. As Orbs enters 2026, more details will be shared on how the DAO will shape governance, participation, and the ecosystem's long-term direction. Community input will play a central role in the next phase to ensure that Orbs continues to evolve in ways that reflect the builders, partners, and users who rely on it.
