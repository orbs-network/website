Dear Orbs enthusiasts,

It has been a long journey and the project wouldn't have come so far without the contributions of our amazing community. This is why, we've decided to show our gratitude and share with all of you a brand-new awesome NFT collection - Orbs Universe Gang, designed and dedicated to the Orbs community.

Hence, we're starting an exciting series of contests  to give out the entire collection to the community. Each couple of weeks, a new contest will be held to choose the lucky winners.

Meet the [Orbso NFT collection](https://opensea.io/collection/orbso-universe-gang) - 77 exclusively designed Orbso NFT cards, including a gang of 70 basic NFTs - Orbso Mobsters (divided into seven groups of ten), plus a special and even more exciting group of 7 unique NFTs - Orbso Bosses.

**Check them out:**

**You can also view the entire collection on OpenSea in the following [link](https://opensea.io/collection/orbso-universe-gang)**.

Every couple of weeks, there will be a new exciting contest with its own rules; and for each contest you will get a chance to win one of the Orbs NFT heroes. First, you will have a chance to win the 70 Orbso Mobster NFTs (Mario, Cosmos,¬† Diver, Jedi, Lover, Gym and Grateful), divided into groups with unique backgrounds. The series of contests will culminate in the chance to win the Orbso Bosses (King, Thor, Barbie, Zombie).

So, how does it work? Each week a new contest will be announced with its own special challenges and rules.
