**The Orbs team is excited to introduce the brand new Orbs Developer Documentation!**

You can check it out in the following link:
https://docs.orbs.network/v3/overview/what-is-orbs

This is an important initiative with a goal to streamline development on the Orbs network by developers and contributors from the broad crypto ecosystem.

Orbs’ [L3 technology](https://www.orbs.com/network/) for enhancing the capabilities of smart contracts opens up a whole new spectrum of possibilities for developers working on Web 3.0, DeFi, NFTs and GameFi Dapps, and the Orbs Developer Documentation is the best place to start this process!


### Focus on Resources for Developers

The first section of the Orbs GitBook contains a useful overview of the basics of the Orbs project such as Layer 3 technology, Orbs network diagram, white papers, etc.

In the main section, there is in-depth focus on Orbs’ two execution services: [Orbs Lambda](https://www.orbs.com/Deep-Dive-to-Orbs-Lambda/) and [Orbs VM](https://www.orbs.com/Deep-Dive-to-Orbs-VM/).

These are both serverless and decentralized execution services, similar in concept to AWS Lambda and EC2 respectively, only decentralized. Orbs Lambda & VM provide powerful tools for developers to overcome various [limitations](https://docs.orbs.network/v3/overview/enhanced-execution) of smart contracts without sacrificing decentralization. Dapps that currently rely on their own centralized backends are welcome to migrate these backends to Orbs VM and eliminate the centralized bottlenecks from their offering.

Developers will find a step-by-step flow for setting up their Lambda or VM functions powered by the Orbs network, along with example use-cases.

### Ongoing Effort for the Orbs Project Documentation 

The Orbs Developer Documentation is meant to be the primary source of knowledge for contributing and building on the Orbs network.

As the project grows and new features & use-cases are being introduced, the Orbs devs docs will be constantly updated with the most up-to-date information for the use of contributors and developers.

As always, any feedback on this new tool will be greatly appreciated!
