On-chain privacy has become a critical need for DeFi users, especially those trading perpetual futures. To meet this demand, Orbs has integrated its Perpetual Hub with PriveX on the COTI network. This collaboration combines Orb’s Layer-3 execution infrastructure with COTI’s privacy-preserving architecture to enable secure, accessible, and efficient intent-based perpetual trading.. By integrating Orbs’ decentralized execution layer with COTI’s privacy-focused architecture, PriveX traders gain enhanced privacy, capital efficiency, and access to deep liquidity to deliver a perpetual futures experience on par with CeFi, while remaining fully decentralized.

[*Orbs*](https://www.orbs.com/) *is a decentralized infrastructure layer executed by a public network of permissionless validators using dPoS, staked with tens of millions of dollars in total value locked (TVL). Orbs Layer-3 infrastructure optimizes on-chain trading by providing aggregated liquidity, advanced trading orders, and decentralized derivatives, enabling a DeFi trading experience as efficient as CeFi.*

### What is Orbs Perpetual Hub?

Built on Orbs' Layer 3 technology, it enhances order execution, capital efficiency, and risk management for DeFi platforms. It enables projects to offer leveraged trading without relying on centralized intermediaries, combining advanced features such as automated liquidations, intent-based execution, and deep liquidity routing in a trustless, on-chain environment.
