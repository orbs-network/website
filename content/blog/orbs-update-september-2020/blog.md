## **It's DeFi Time!**

![](/assets/img/blog/orbs-update-september-2020/defi-1030x579.jpg)

Hi everyone!

DeFi is definitely the hot yam right now, no question about that. The Orbs team has recognized the huge potential of DeFi and is now dedicating more time and resources to research this field.

In this issue, we will review the **Orbs Ecosystem Grant Program (OEGP)** and explain how the Orbs Network is suited to be integrated into DeFi projects in an optimal way.

However, this is not all, the team is already hard at work on several DeFi related projects - expect more news in this regard!

...

## **Orbs Ecosystem Grant Program**

Orbs is committed to advance the process of decentralization by involving even more developers and teams in the development of the Orbs ecosystem and is introducing the Orbs Ecosystem Grant Program (OEGP). We believe that the special features of the blockchain infrastructure of the Orbs Network and the incredibly strong and active community in the Orbs PoS Universe together provide a unique opportunity to interface and collaborate with DeFi protocols.

[**READ THE ORBS ECOSYSTEM GRANT PROGRAM PAPER**](https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/orbs-grant-program-2/)

Any team or individual can submit a proposal to receive a grant for DeFi projects that may integrate with Orbs ecosystem. Such projects include among others: Liquidity pools, collateral-backed loans, oracles, and more. Once submitted, the Orbs team will evaluate the proposal and approved applications will have the means to carry out their project in collaboration with the Orbs team.

Already we have seen a lot of interest in the OEGP, and we will update the community on the progress of this exciting enterprise.

### Exploring DeFi with the Orbs Grant Program

In this blog post, Tal Kol lays down the Orbs team‚Äôs approach to DeFi and how the Orbs Network has an advantage over other infrastructure projects, as it is an ERC20 token built on Ethereum. This means that the ORBS token can be directly integrated with any major DeFi project ‚Äì a task that would be very difficult for other projects such as EOS and Tezos to accomplish.

In addition, there aren‚Äôt many other PoS projects with tokens running on Ethereum. This gives the Orbs Network another interesting advantage. The use of governance tokens brings a lot of value in DeFi, take MKR for example. The Guardian community successfully assembled in the Orbs PoS Universe is able to supply secure decentralized governance backed by a very large community of staked delegators.

## **Orbs PoS V2: The Age of Guardians**

So far **13 Guardians** have joined the PoS V2 Beta Program and are actively running V2 nodes.

All in all, the V2 Beta Period is progressing smoothly, and according to the schedule set by the team. A big thank you to all the V2 Guardians for their cooperation and hard work! üõ°

### Beta Promotion Rewards

üèÜüèÜ August DAI distribution has been delivered to all V2 Guardians, as part of the Beta Promotion Rewards Program! üèÜüèÜ

...

## **State of the Network**

We want to highlight again the huge milestone that the Orbs Network has achieved:

There are now **OVER 1 BILLION ORBS** tokens locked in the new staking contract. This is a new all-time high staking record for the Orbs Network!

### ![](/assets/img/blog/orbs-update-september-2020/1b-staked-1030x634.jpg)

A high staking percentage demonstrates confidence in the project by token holders as well as contributes to the security of the Orbs Network.

1 billion ORBS token staked represent approximately 50% of the ORBS circulating supply. This puts Orbs on the right path in terms of staking percentage when compared to some high profile PoS projects such as Cardano, Cosmos and Polkadot , as can be seen in the graph below:

## **Previews and Teasers**

The team is working on a new and improved website. The main focus is revising the content per the recent developments in the project, such as Orbs PoS V2: The Age of Guardians, but also updating the overall design.

Here is a small teaser from the new website design. Wait until you see the finished product - you will be blown away!

## **Meet the Orbs Team Vlog**

We think it's important for the community to get to know the team members better, as well as receive constant updates on the work that‚Äôs been done.

Therefore, with the help of the wonderful Bar, we have decided to make periodic short videos with different members from the team, who will tell you a little bit about their background and talk about what they‚Äôve been up to lately.

Last time, Bar interviewed Orbs co-founder Tal Kol, who is always interesting to listen to. In case you missed it, here it is:
