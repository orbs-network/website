**We are excited to announce that the ORBS token is now available on [SpiritSwap](https://www.spiritswap.finance/), one of the biggest DEX-AMMs on Fantom with almost $200M in TVL!**

In a [recent](https://www.orbs.com/Multichain/) blog post we announced that the ORBS token is now available on Fantom using the Multichain cross-chain bridge between Ethereum, BSC, Avalanche and Fantom. Since then, Orbs has been added to [SpookySwap](https://www.orbs.com/ORBS-is-now-live-on-SpookySwap/), the biggest DEX-AMM on Fantom, and the Orbs token address can be found on [FTMScan](https://www.orbs.com/FTMScan/), the official Fantom block explorer.

**SpiritSwap is the second major integration on Fantom and an important step to solidifying Orbs presence on this new chain!**

### In the Spirit of DeFi

SpiritSwap is an exciting & innovative DeFi AMM on Fantom. Apart from the standard features of swaps, adding liquidity and farming, Spirit also introduced their own version of vote-locked token called [inSPIRIT](https://docs.spiritswap.finance/spirit-swap/inspirit). 

There are currently 2 active [ORBS pools](https://info.spiritswap.finance/token/0x3e01b7e242d5af8064cb9a8f9468ac0f8683617c) on Spirit: ORBS-USDC and ORBS-FTM, with ~$25k in liquidity each. This means that users can now add liquidity and swap ORBS tokens on SpiritSwap.

As always, before embarking onto a new chain, there are several things you need to remember:

1) **Set up a Fantom compatible wallet:** If you’re using the Metamask wallet, here is a [quick guide](https://docs.fantom.foundation/tutorials/set-up-metamask) on how to configure Metamask for Fantom.
2) **Choose a cross-chain bridge:** We recommend using the Multichain bridge as described in our recent [blog post](https://www.orbs.com/Multichain/) on the subject. 
3) **Fund your wallet with FTM tokens:** You can now bridge ORBS tokens into your Fantom wallet. In addition, make sure to send some FTM tokens - FTM is the native token on the Fantom network used to pay transaction fees. 

**You are now ready to use SpiritSwap on Fantom!**


### Another Major Integration on Fantom!

Orbs’ [expansion](https://www.orbs.com/Fantom/) into the Fantom ecosystem is off to a great start with these integrations to Spooky and Spirit, two of the largest DEX-AMMs on Fantom.

With this latest integration, Orbs is now available on 7 major infrastructure chains: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, Harmony and Fantom. In addition, Orbs can be found on well over 30 of the major DeFi platforms and protocols on each of these chains (such as UniSwap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, Kyber Network, 1inch, Alpaca Finance, Beefy Finance, QuickSwap, DinoSwap, Raydium, Trader Joe, Pangolin, SpookySwap, with more to come in the near future...).

**Fantom is one of the fastest growing DeFi ecosystems, offering a lot of untapped potential.**

Orbs is just getting started on Fantom, expect more news to come soon…
