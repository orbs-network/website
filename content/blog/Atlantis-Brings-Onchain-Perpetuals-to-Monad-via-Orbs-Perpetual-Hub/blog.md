Atlantis has integrated Orbs’ Perpetual Hub Ultra to power perpetual futures trading on Monad. Built on a modular V4 architecture, Atlantis expands beyond spot trading with a plug-and-play perps infrastructure, reinforcing its position as a complete DeFi hub while showcasing Orbs technology as the underlying execution layer for advanced onchain derivatives.

With this upgrade, Atlantis’ users gain access to deep liquidity, customizable leverage, and efficient execution, all through a fully managed, modular perps stack.

Powered by Orbs’ Layer-3 infrastructure, this deployment builds on successful integrations of Perpetual Hub \[legacy\], cementing Orbs as the industry standard for turnkey perps infrastructure in DeFi.

[*Orbs*](https://www.orbs.com/) *is a decentralized infrastructure layer executed by a public network of permissionless validators using dPoS, staked with tens of millions of dollars in total value locked (TVL). Orbs Layer-3 infrastructure optimizes on-chain trading by providing aggregated liquidity, advanced trading orders, and decentralized derivatives, enabling a DeFi trading experience as efficient as CeFi.*

## About Perpetual Hub Ultra

Perpetual Hub Ultra is a fully integrated perpetual futures trading protocol developed by Orbs and Symm.io. It provides everything needed by DEXs looking to launch a high-performance perps platform, including hedging, liquidation, oracles, and a professional grade UI, all powered by Orbs’ Layer 3 decentralized infrastructure and Symm.io’s smart contract system.

Built for scalability and capital efficiency, once integrated, Ultra enables platforms to route liquidity from both onchain and offchain sources, including major centralized exchanges like Binance. This allows protocols to offer deep execution without needing to build a specialized chain or complex backend. By packaging the full perps stack into a modular integration layer, Ultra allows DEXs, frontends, and aggregators to deploy perps with minimal development effort and fast time to market.

As intent based trading continues to dominate DEX volume in spot markets, Perpetual Hub Ultra brings this same model to perps, enabling a new generation of trading venues to compete with centralized exchanges in performance, flexibility, and user experience while remaining fully decentralized.
