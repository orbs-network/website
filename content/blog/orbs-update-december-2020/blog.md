## Orbs PoS V2.5: The Age of Guardians

**It’s official!**

With the success of the Beta period, Orbs PoS V2.5: The Age of Guardians has officially launched!

This is truly a momentous occasion in the history of the Orbs Network (second only to the Orbs mainnet launch back in 2019), which will place Orbs PoS architecture at the forefront of public blockchain infrastructure projects.

V2.5 contains a variety of crucial improvements, including automating reward distribution on the protocol, empowering Guardians to determine the level of distribution to Delegators, allowing Delegators to collect their rewards on their own schedule, streamlining validator node operations, moving additional parts of the PoS system to Ethereum, imposing a minimum self-delegation requirement, creating a more sustainable reward rate and adopting a new architecture for reducing gas prices based on the state of the art contract design patterns that are gaining popularity in yield farming contracts.

The launch of V2.5 comes after several months of successful testing and use of V2 and V2.5 in beta form. This process has allowed for the network to be streamlined and improved based on the input and contributions of many Orbs Network participants. We’d like to thank everyone who contributed to this great achievement, your hard work and dedication helped make Orbs PoS V2.5 into reality.

**We just want to remind everyone that from now on only V2.5 Guardians and their respective Delegators are eligible for staking rewards. We urge all Delegators to make sure that they’re delegating their ORBS tokens to an active V2.5 Guardian.**

The successful transition to Orbs PoS Universe V2.5: The Age of Guardians emphasizes the resilience and commitment of the Orbs community.

Once again we’d like to thank everyone for their important contributions.

A big round of applause to everyone who was involved!

## Orbs DeFi

The Orbs ecosystem is making great progress towards integration with the DeFi space.

A couple of months after receiving their grant as part of the [Orbs Ecosystem Grant Program (OEGP)](https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/orbs-grant-program-2/),  the Paradigm team has been hard at work on completing their project’s milestones.

In a short period, they already have set up a liquidity pool on Balancer and Uniswap, and are now working on the Orbs DeFi Portal, which is looking great.

Here is a short recap of everything that’s been going on so far as well as the next steps on the roadmap:

Following the V2.5 launch event, the last V1 rewards assignment and distribution will take place, and thereafter, V1 will be discontinued. V1 had a great run during the first year after the network launch, but the new V2.5 has improved on this success in really important and powerful ways.

### Hexa Foundation - Blockchain to Report Child Abuse

In 2018, child abuse reports involved 7.8 million children in America, and yet, there is no National Database for child abuse allegations. Each state acts alone without coordination.

We must do better!

Here's how blockchain may help...

## Orbs Team Updates

We are excited to announce that we have moved our offices to a new location.

The new offices are very close to our old offices, but rather than being on the top floor of one of Tel-Aviv’s highest skyscrapers, they are in a 3 story renovated townhouse in the Sarona Market district.

The new offices are a little smaller and without the birds-eye view, but everyone in the team agrees that there is a much more cozy and homey feeling.

A fresh start to an amazing new year ahead!
