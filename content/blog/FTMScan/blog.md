**We are excited to announce that the ORBS token is now available on FTMScan, the leading block explorer for the Fantom network.**

The [FTMScan explorer ](https://ftmscan.com/)enables users to search the Fantom blockchain for transactions, top accounts, verified contracts, statistics, addresses, tokens, prices and other activities taking place on Fantom (FTM).

In a recent [post](https://www.orbs.com/Multichain/) we announced that the ORBS token is now available on [Fantom](https://fantom.foundation/) via [Multichain](https://app.multichain.org/#/router) Cross-Chain Bridge. Following that successful integration, Orbs is now officially part of Fantom ecosystem!

As a result, ORBS tokens can now be tracked on the Fantom blockchain using the FTMScan explorer.

**ORBS Contract on Fantom**

The official ORBS token contract address on Fantom blockchain is:

[0x3E01B7E242D5AF8064cB9A8F9468aC0f8683617c](https://ftmscan.com/token/0x3e01b7e242d5af8064cb9a8f9468ac0f8683617c)

**Always make sure to verify the token address before making a transaction.**

**Fantom - Rock Star of the Blockchain Space**

Fantom is one of the most recent layer-1 blockchains to enter the blockchain ecosystem. With its unique value proposition and laser-focus on DeFi applications, Fantom's rise has been meteoric. As of today, Fantom ranked the number 4 chain in terms of TVL by defillama, with over $12B in TVL.

**FTMScan Useful Tools & Features**

Here're some of the FTMScan features you might find helpful:

-   [Verified contracts](https://ftmscan.com/contractsVerified) - like on Etherscan, FTMscan users can audit and read the code and interact with the contracts directly.

-   [Top Accounts](https://ftmscan.com/accounts): top accounts show the leaderboard of FTM Opera holders, sorting them by balance.

-   [Charts and stats](https://ftmscan.com/charts) - charts and statistics enable to measure on-chain traffic and network usage.

**Explore More about Orbs and Fantom**

In the last couple of months, Orbs team has been focused on unlocking the value of [Orbs 3.0](https://www.orbs.com/Orbs3.0/) as Layer-3 infrastructure secured by multi-chain PoS staking.

Thus, the Orbs team has, so far, integrated Orbs into the leading L1+L2 chains, making it available on 7 major infrastructure chains: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, Harmony and Fantom. This further facilitated the integration of Orbs with over 30 of the major DeFi platforms and protocols (such as Serum, Snowball, Rango, UniSwap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, Kyber Network, 1inch, Alpaca Finance, Beefy Finance, QuickSwap, DinoSwap, WOWswap, Raydium, Trader Joe, Pangolin, AnySwap, etc, with more to come in the near future...).

Orbs' strategic expansion into the Fantom ecosystem will further solidify the ORBS token's status as a multi-chain asset which is integrated into all the major chains. In addition, it will open the door for more opportunities for collaborations with top Fantom-native DeFi protocols to showcase Orbs' L3 capabilities.

More updates to be released soon!
