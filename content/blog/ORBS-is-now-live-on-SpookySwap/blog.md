**BOO!** 😱😱😱

Did we scare you? Good! 
Because we have some big news for you - 

**We are excited to announce that the ORBS token is now available on [SpookySwap](https://spookyswap.finance/), the leading DEX-AMM on Fantom!**

SpookySwap is the biggest DEX-AMM on Fantom, with just under $1bn in total locked value (TVL) and over $150M in average daily trading volume.

In a [recent](https://www.orbs.com/Multichain/) blog post we announced that the ORBS token is now available on Fantom using the Multichain cross-chain bridge between Ethereum, BSC, Avalanche and Fantom. In addition, the Orbs token address was [added](https://www.orbs.com/FTMScan/) to FTMScan, the leading Fantom block explorer.

**Following these successful integrations, Fantom users can now swap and add liquidity to Orbs pools on SpookySwap!**


### Let’s Get Spooky With It


There are currently 2 active [ORBS pools](https://info.spookyswap.finance/token/0x3e01b7e242d5af8064cb9a8f9468ac0f8683617c) on Spooky, the largest of which is ORBS-USDC with over $110k in total liquidity. When searching for the ORBS token in the tokens list, you may need to add the ORBS token by entering the ORBS [contract address](https://ftmscan.com/token/0x3e01b7e242d5af8064cb9a8f9468ac0f8683617c) in the search bar.

As always, before embarking onto a new chain, there are several things you need to remember:

1) **Set up a Fantom compatible wallet:** If you’re using the Metamask wallet, here is a [quick guide](https://docs.fantom.foundation/tutorials/set-up-metamask) on how to configure Metamask for Fantom.
2) **Choose a cross-chain bridge:** We recommend using the Multichain bridge as described in our recent [blog post](https://www.orbs.com/Multichain/) on the subject. 
3) **Fund your wallet with FTM tokens:** You can now bridge ORBS tokens into your Fantom wallet. In addition, make sure to send some FTM tokens - FTM is the native token on the Fantom network used to pay transaction fees. 

**You are now ready to use SpookySwap on Fantom!**


### 1st Major Integration on Fantom!

Orbs’ [expansion](https://www.orbs.com/Fantom/) into the Fantom ecosystem is off to a great start with this integration to Spooky, the largest DEX-AMM on Fantom!

With this latest integration, Orbs is now available on 7 major infrastructure chains: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, Harmony and Fantom. In addition, Orbs can be found on well over 30 of the major DeFi platforms and protocols on each of these chains (such as UniSwap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, Kyber Network, 1inch, Alpaca Finance, Beefy Finance, QuickSwap, DinoSwap, Raydium, Trader Joe, Pangolin, SpookySwap, with more to come in the near future...).

**Fantom is one of the fastest growing DeFi ecosystems, offering a lot of untapped potential. Orbs is just getting started on Fantom, expect more news to come soon!**
