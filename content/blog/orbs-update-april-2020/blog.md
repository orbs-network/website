**Welcome back to our monthly recap everyone!**

Now we’ve experienced _another_ full month of work while physically isolated from one another completely. While this may not have been great for my fitness or grooming, it has been good to make remote working in global teams a habit that we seem to be clearly getting better at. Improvise, adapt, overcome!

And on the topic of overcoming, Orbs core team members have also been working on an app for motivating mobile users to stick to their COVID19 quarantines, which is already available on Google Play:

#### New on the Block

Finally, Orbs is thrilled to have Nadav Shemesh join the team as the newest Partner!

Nadav recently served as senior advisor to Israel’s Finance Minister. He is a former fighter pilot and has a strong background in technology and management, We are confident that his contribution to Orbs will lead the development of blockchain technology to new heights.

**Welcome Nadav!**

## State of the Network

_This segment was contributed by [@Andrey](https://community.orbs.network/u/andrey/summary)_

There are 19 registered Guardians and 16 Validators running in production. There are now over 1700 Delegators participating in the Orbs PoS ecosystem, and over 200 of them are already staking through Tetra, the new staking wallet!

There are 2 applications running on the Orbs Network:

**Vchain 1960000** — Open-Rights ([https://www.open-rights.org/](https://www.open-rights.org/))

**Vchain 1970000** — Receipts Notarization ([https://www.linet.org.il/](https://www.linet.org.il/))

A  real community effort!

Following the launch of Tetra and the new staking mechanism, we have listened carefully to your feedback and held discussions with many of the network Guardians.

As discussed in the [official Orbs channel](https://t.me/OrbsNetwork), the locking period duration is a tradeoff between network security and Delegators’ participation. After extensive discussion with the community and further analysis of the state of the network, it's been decided to change it to 14 days.

Looking at the token balance in the new staking contract (7-20 April period), we can see a positive upward trend and healthy delegators’ participation right off the start:

We would like to thank all of the guardians and community members who offered proposals and feedback. Your contribution was crucial in helping to reach a better decision regarding the new staking mechanism.

Lastly, we would like to especially commend _JJANG Orbs_ Guardian, for transitioning more than 90% of his delegators onto the new staking mechanism, well done!

On 8th April, we announced a new PoS system V2 is launched with a new staking wallet, Tetra. Now you can join us with [Tetra](http://staking.orbs.network) and an updated [ORBS PoS Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.pos).

**Read more:** _[**Introducing Locking When Staking ORBS**](https://www.orbs.com/introducing-locking-when-staking-orbs/)_

Over 300M tokens are staked until now and still in growth. Probably more by the time you read this :)

Also, following our active community members' feedback, the team is already under improvement to make Tetra easier and better. I am so happy to see that you and we all contribute together. Thank you, gang!

During the transition period, non-staked tokens by contract also will be rewarded as is. And rewards for locked tokens will be added on your staked tokens in the smart contract.
