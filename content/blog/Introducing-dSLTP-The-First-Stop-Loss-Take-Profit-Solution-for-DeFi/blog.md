Orbs is thrilled to introduce dSLTP - the first-ever decentralized stop order protocol for DEXs. Built on Orbs’ Layer-3 (L3) infrastructure, dSLTP brings reliable, robust, and efficient stop-loss and take-profit execution to decentralized trading, all without compromising security and decentralization.

_dSLTP joins the Orbs Advanced Trading Orders Suite, alongside [dLIMIT](https://www.orbs.com/dlimit/) and [dTWAP](https://www.orbs.com/dtwap/), expanding DeFi’s capabilities with CeFi-grade trading features._

### Why Stop Orders Matter in DeFi

Stop orders are critical tools for strategic trading and risk management. They help traders:

- Protect their portfolio with stop-loss orders that limit potential downside.
- Secure profits through take-profit orders that automatically lock in gains at target levels.
- Automate execution without needing to constantly monitor the market.


A **stop-loss** order automatically sells a token once its price drops below a predefined level, helping traders limit losses in volatile markets. Stop-loss orders are essential in fast-moving markets, offering peace of mind and protection when the market turns against you.

A **take-profit** order automatically sells once the price reaches your target profit level.


When used together, stop-loss and take-profit create a balanced risk/reward strategy — maximizing upside while controlling downside exposure.

**Until now, such tools were primarily available only on CEXs. With dSLTP, this changes — making advanced order automation accessible directly on DEXs.**


### A User-friendly, Customizable UI

dStopLoss comes with a specialized UI that can be easily integrated and customized by any DEX, to create an intuitive, user-friendly and informative way for users to set up their stop orders.

dSLTP supports both stop-market and stop-limit orders, giving the users the ability to set up the optimal configuration that suits their need:

- **Stop-market** orders guarantee that your order will be executed once the stop price is triggered. However, in fast or volatile markets, slippage can occur, and the executed price may be significantly worse than the trigger price. This means the amount of output tokens received could be lower than expected.
- **Stop-limit** orders protect against receiving a worse price than your specified limit. Once the stop price is triggered, the order will execute only at the limit price or better. The downside is that if the market price falls below your limit, the order may not execute at all.

For more information on how to set up a stop-order, see the dSLTP [documentation](https://docs.orbs.network/v3) and [FAQ page](https://www.orbs.com/dtwap-and-dlimit-faq/), or visit the dSLTP telegram [support group](https://t.me/dTWAPSupportGroup).
