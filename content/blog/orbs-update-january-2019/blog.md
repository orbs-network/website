**Letter from Daniel Peled, Orbs President and Co-Founder**

![Daniel Peled](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*xYm7AFZ6FJhLjDR_5Z37OQ.jpeg)

_The beginning of any year is exciting, but there is something uniquely powerful about kicking off 2019 with our launch just around the corner. Watching the process of building Orbs, and all of the work that has gone into it, has been both inspiring and exciting, recognizing the dedication of our team and the potential that our product has to make the blockchain promise a reality._

_For me personally it reinforces the very elements that brought me to the industry in the first place. These factors motivated me to get involved, and now serve as guiding principles to help define the future we can take and the impact we can have._

**_Breaking Silos_**

_There is a tendency in any movement to let the ideals run wild and to lose touch with the very elements that will help make the dream a tangible reality. For blockchain to take hold, we must create a path that leverages real world usage as a necessary predecessor to public blockchains with a clear path on how to make this process unfold. Because of this perspecti_ve_, we have committed ourselves to being requirement driven in how we build our product and our company so that we don’t just speak to the potential of blockchain but play a fundamental role in bringing the technology to the masses.\_

_We know that if we can get businesses on board, and bring value to users, we can make the technology fulfill its potential. This is why we focus so much on our design partners and the feedback we receive from business building real products on Orbs._

**_Building a Trust Based System_**

_One of the fundamental promises of blockchain is to redefine how we work, collaborate, communicate and more with a system that is trustless. The result is a business and societal standard where exploitation is replaced with empowerment and knowledge. Where individuals are finally given a significant role within the value exchange and where fair competition is enabled._

_In the words of_ [_Joel Monegro_](https://www.usv.com/blog/fat-protocols)_, “by replicating and storing user data across an open and decentralized network rather than individual applications controlling access to disparate silos of information, we reduce the barriers to entry for new players and create a more vibrant and competitive ecosystem of products and services on top”. 2019 will allow us to take a major step forward in realizing this vision._

**_The New Company_**

_Blockchain doesn’t just bring a new technology, it enables the creation of a new type of venture. The alignment between an asset, a product and all of the players involved in the cycle of usage is a massive leap forward. With Orbs, we aren’t just creating an amazing product, we are creating a different type of business; one that we will build, support and drive forward, together._

_So when we look back, and more importantly, when we look forward, we are grateful to the individuals and partners who have helped us get this far and are excited to add more individuals and partners to this journey moving forward._

_To an amazing 2019 for us all,_

### Ending 2018 on a high: New partners, new products

Here’s some of what we’ve been up to for the past month and change (for dev news, scroll down to R&D Updates):

![Big in Japan](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZFkDZjvttnn1YY16fuCxEQ.png)

**Kakao Investment Joins the Orbs Journey**

South Korea’s internet and communications giant [Kakao](https://finance.naver.com/item/main.nhn?code=035720) (of KakaoTalk) [announced](https://medium.com/orbs-network/kakao-investment-dives-in-to-orbs-eb7f397070bb) last month that it has partnered with Orbs! The investment in the Orbs product builds on an existing partnership with Kakao’s own blockchain subsidiary Ground X from just months ago. As part of the partnership, the two companies agreed to partner on blockchain applications, research and development projects.

In their own words: “Kakao Investment is focused on identifying key trendsetters and innovators in the blockchain sector and Orbs is a great example,” said Kris Park, Executive Director of Kakao Investment. “The company has developed an innovative business model and possesses unique technological capabilities, enabling us to support the company and maximize its potential.”

Exciting!

#### Gamma Local Testnet Environment is available NOW!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*rTXOrKtsssehggOh0aiQjg.jpeg)

With tremendous excitement and after much anticipation and sleeplessness, [we’ve launched Gamma](https://medium.com/orbs-network/orbs-launches-gamma-local-testing-environment-ahead-of-2019-production-launch-ee0ac277544e), the local testing environment for developers preparing for the launch of the Orbs production platform. Gamma will create a local blockchain on each machine to allow developers to write and test smart contracts using the Orbs Smart Contract SDK.

As part of the exciting Gamma launch, Orbs rolled out the shiny new command line interface [Gamma-CLI](https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-contract-sdk/blob/master/GAMMA.md), the client developers need to interact with their personal Orbs blockchain and design partners to access the full testnet. Launching Gamma and Gamma-CLI constitutes a major step to the release of the full Orbs production layer of in early 2019 with which developers and businesses will begin testing the platform.

The emphasis throughout our creation of Gamma-CLI has always been on simplicity, user experience, and speed-speed-speed. In the words of Orbs President Daniel Peled: _“Our focus remains on creating the optimal platform for building large scale applications and to help improve this process, we wanted to give partners and developers the time they need to test and learn on our system.”_

Orbs’ dynamic product roadmap highlights several key updates to the project’s readiness, geared up for the full launch of a production ready platform. The period until launch will be used to work closely with partners and developers, helping them optimize their onboarding process ahead of the launch set for early 2019.

#### Yes24 partnership
