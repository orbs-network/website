Orbs unveiling Liquidity Hub V2, a groundbreaking upgrade to the benchmark-setting Liquidity Hub introduced over a year ago. Initially launched in collaboration with our design advisor QuickSwap, Liquidity Hub has since become a cornerstone of decentralized trading, seamlessly integrating across nine venues and chains. By redefining liquidity optimization and providing unmatched execution quality, Liquidity Hub established itself as the gold standard for decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

With V2, Orbs continues to innovate, leveraging insights from our growing ecosystem to set an even higher bar for decentralized liquidity. This milestone reflects not only our commitment to advancing the DeFi landscape but also the collective contributions of the broader Orbs community. From guardians and on-chain routers to solvers, off-chain liquidity providers, and DEX platforms, the Orbs ecosystem remains a unified force driving the future of on-chain trading.

### A Brief History

When the original Liquidity Hub launched, it was designed to address a persistent gap in the DEX ecosystem: fragmented liquidity and suboptimal pricing. This was to be achieved by unifying liquidity across chains and v, and Liquidityidity Hub delivered on its promise of creating a seamless and efficient trading experience.

In collaboration with QuickSwap, Liquidity Hub introduced the first truly integrated liquidity framework, enabling traders to enjoy better execution prices and increased efficiency. Over the past year, Liquidity Hub has:

* Integrated across nine venues and chains, ensuring wide accessibility.  
* Delivered superior pricing and efficiency, challenging centralized exchanges (CEXs) in execution quality.  
* Brought innovation to the forefront of DeFi, becoming a trusted tool for traders, liquidity providers, and DEX operators alike.

This legacy of innovation and reliability paved the way for Liquidity Hub V2, a transformative upgrade that meets the evolving demands of decentralized trading.

### Introducing Liquidity Hub V2: Key Upgrades

Dynamic Fees  
With Liquidity Hub V2, fees are no longer static. Instead, they are calculated in real-time as a percentage of the savings achieved, independent of Dutch auction decay. This approach ensures that traders benefit from optimized costs, even under negative slippage conditions, making every trade more efficient and cost-effective.

Enhanced AMM Router Price Simulation  
To maintain its edge over automated market makers (AMMs), Liquidity Hub now continuously monitors AMM prices throughout the Dutch auction process. This enhancement ensures that Liquidity Hub consistently outperforms AMM prices, even during volatile market conditions, resulting in smoother and more effective trades.

Provable Outcomes with LH Explorer  
Transparency is paramount in decentralized trading. The new LH Explorer tool provides complete visibility into every transaction, showcasing:

* AMM simulated prices  
* Liquidity Hub prices  
* Fees  
* Gas costs  
* Savings and more

This level of detail empowers users with the confidence that comes from knowing they are receiving optimal execution in every trade.

Liquidity Hub V2 is being rolled out across all venues without any interruptions to users’ trading experiences. This seamless transition ensures zero downtime while delivering enhanced liquidity prices and performance, underscoring Orbs’ dedication to excellence.

### Why Liquidity Hub V2 Matters

Liquidity Hub V2 is more than just an upgrade—it’s a decisive step forward in addressing the persistent challenges of decentralized liquidity. By combining real-time fee optimization, continuous AMM price monitoring, and provable outcomes through LH Explorer, V2 delivers:

* Better execution prices for traders.  
* Full transparency and confidence in every trade.  
* Enhanced competitiveness for DEX operators, enabling them to attract more liquidity providers and traders.

Together, these improvements are reshaping the decentralized trading landscape, empowering the Orbs ecosystem to stand as a formidable alternative to CEXs while driving the next wave of growth in DeFi.
