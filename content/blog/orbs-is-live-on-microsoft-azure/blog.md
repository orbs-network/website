### For Developers, by Developers

We recently [announced](https://www.orbs.com/orbs-live-on-amazon-ami-published-by-aws-marketplace/) that Orbs has been fully integrated into Amazon AMI.

From now on, you can also find Orbs on Microsoft Azure!

Microsoft Azure, together with AWS, are the top 2 most popular cloud providers, with over 50% of the total market share. Having Orbs integrated into both ensures that the majority of developers will be able to set up a virtual machine image, containing everything needed to start developing on Orbs

Click [here](https://docs.orbs.network/contract-sdk/gamma-in-depth/deploying-gamma-in-the-cloud) for instructions on how to use the Orbs Mirror Imaging on AWS and MS Azure.

### Strong emphasis on DeFi

Orbs is developing a collection of protocols to help CeFi players and real-world businesses integrate with DeFi and take part in the incredible growth and innovation this industry is showing.

The main idea of DeFi is that every contract is interoperable with every other contract. Since all contracts are pure code with well-defined API’s, working together is easier than ever.  In the new DeFi world, all a developer needs to do is take a look at the contract’s API available to anyone on-chain, and start developing straight away.

Having a strong presence on popular cloud infrastructures makes this process easier than ever, and is another important step for attracting developers towards the Orbs ecosystem.

### Learn More

Orbs is a permissionless, open-source blockchain infrastructure project. Blockchain allows communities to collaborate on running systems together, we see this as the next step beyond open source. A critical part of adoption is a hands-on experience by the developers themselves. Creating an optimal developer environment and tools is one of our top priorities.
