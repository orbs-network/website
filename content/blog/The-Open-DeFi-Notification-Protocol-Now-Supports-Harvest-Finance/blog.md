The Open DeFi Notifications Protocol has integrated [Harvest Finance](https://harvest.finance/), a leading Vault protocol on Ethereum, Polygon and BSC, to provide its users with free mobile notification for on-chain events.

Harvest users can now receive real-time notifications for their positions to better manage their trading strategies and risk.

The [Open DeFi Notification Protocol](https://defi.org/notifications/) App is available on both [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp).

The Open DeFi Notification Protocol by [defi.org](https://defi.org/) is a community led initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events.


### The Best Way to Manage Your Yield

The Open DeFi Notification provides users with free and dependable mobile notifications for on-chain events in order to optimize their DeFi trading strategies and help them manage their risk. The Notification app can be used to keep track of rewards when providing liquidity, set up stop-loss alerts, help avoid impermanent loss, and more.

There is currently one type of notification available for Harvest:

**Pending Reward:** Get notified when your $FARM rewards are above a specified threshold.
