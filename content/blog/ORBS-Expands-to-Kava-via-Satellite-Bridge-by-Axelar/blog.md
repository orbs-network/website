Orbs, the native token of the Orbs network has been beamed onto Kava, a major L1 with over 192 million dollars in [TVL](https://defillama.com/chain/Kava)! This was facilitated by Satellite bridge powered by Axelar!

Bridging ORBS from Ethereum to Kava can be done using the following [link](https://satellite.money/?source=ethereum&destination=kava&asset_denom=orbs-wei&destination_address=).

### About Kava

The Kava Network bills itself as the first Layer-1 blockchain to combine the speed and scalability of the Cosmos SDK with the developer support of Ethereum. Through its unique co-chain architecture, the Kava Network empowers developers to build for Web3 and next-gen blockchain technologies. KAVA is the native governance and staking token of the Kava Network, enabling its decentralization and security.

### Key features

Co-Chain Architecture: The most important feature of the Kava Network is its co-chain architecture, enabling developers to build and deploy their projects using either the EVM or Cosmos SDK execution environments with seamless interoperability between the two. The following diagram shows how the system is expected to function once the Kava 10 upgrade is complete and the Kava Network mainnet goes live.

Kava Network: The co-chains of the Kava Network operate like the two hemispheres of a brain. The Cosmos Co-Chain is optimized for Cosmos ecosystem developers. The Ethereum Co-Chain is optimized for Ethereum ecosystem developers. The Translator Module connects the two distinct execution environments of the Co-Chains, allowing them to work seamlessly together at scale.

This packages two of the industry's two most used execution environments within a single network. Ethereum meets Cosmos via the Kava Network's robust, developer-optimized Layer-1 architecture.

The Ethereum Co-Chain: An EVM-compatible execution environment that empowers Solidity developers and their dApps to benefit from the scalability and security of the Kava Network.

The Cosmos co-chain: Is a highly scalable and secure Cosmos SDK blockchain that connects Kava to the 35+ chains and $60B+ of the Cosmos ecosystem via the IBC protocol.
