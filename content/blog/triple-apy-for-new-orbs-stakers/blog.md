Orbs has received increased attention from the broader web3 ecosystem in October and has seen a significant rise in participation. Among other things, the ORBS token has been listed on over 20 exchanges, including venues like Binance and Bybit. This has helped the community grow. As the Orbs community has grown, so has interest in participating in staking. The Orbs project is decentralized and community-based, valuing community and core web3 values. ¬† One way to solidify the long-term engagement of new community members is to encourage them to take an active part in the work of securing and operating the Orbs Network's technology by participating in the Orbs Proof-of-Stake Universe. To welcome and encourage new community members to participate, the Orbs community approved a governance vote to introduce the Orbs triple APY event for new stake.
