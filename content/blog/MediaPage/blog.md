We're happy to announce that we have updated [Orbs' Media Page](https://www.orbs.com/news/) on Orbs Network website. Feel free to check it out and bookmark it so you can stay up to date on all Orbs happenings.

This is a great time to highlight the fact that over the past year, the Orbs project has frequently made headlines and has been featured by many top media sources, such as [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/defi.org-launches-the-open-defi-notification-protocol-powered-by-the-orbs-network) (1B+ monthly users), [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/defi-org-launches-open-defi-123000053.html#:~:text=Newsfile-,DeFi.org%20Launches%20the%20Open%20DeFi%20Notification%20Protocol%20Powered%20by,Newsfile%20Corp.&text=Orbs%20ushers%20in%20the%20next,on%20Apple%20and%20iOS%20devices) (~1B monthly users), [Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/defiorg-accelerator-launches-open-defi-notification-protocol-by-orbs-2650704) ( 46+M monthly users), and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2022-01-25/defi-org-launches-the-open-defi-notification-protocol-powered-by-the-orbs-network) (76.4+M monthly users).

Orbs was fortunate to draw interest from top-tier media sources and news channels, specifically with respect to Orbs' two latest major announcements.

First, Orbs' Layer 3 value proposition - the new idea that the Orbs blockchain will act as a separate layer on top existing EVM-based L1s and L2s to enhance the capabilities of smart contracts and DeFi applications - made the headlines:

More recently, Orbs' pioneering [PoS V3 Multichain Staking Proposal](https://www.orbs.com/polygon-staking/), which represents a unique approach to putting proof-of-stake on two different chains, drew interest from media giants. Â  Here are just some of them:
