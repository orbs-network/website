Hello Orbs community!

DeFi.org recently launched the public beta app for The Open DeFi Notifications Protocol - a community led initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events, powered by the Orbs network.

You can read more about it [here](https://www.orbs.com/notifications-launch/).

If you’re unfamiliar with the Notification app give it a go! It's available on both [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp).


### Orbs PoS - 2nd most popular notification type

Since the official launch, the app has seen great progress with an increasing trend of active users and over 20 protocol integrations across 5 networks: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Fantom and Avalanche!

One of those integrations includes Orbs PoS notifications which enables Orbs stakers to set up free, real-time notifications to track their staking on both the Ethereum and Polygon chains. 

You can find more info on that in this [link](https://medium.com/@defiorg/the-open-defi-notification-protocol-now-supports-the-orbs-network-f32c9f3d4b78).

Recently, the defi.org team shared some cool stats on the app and, as can be seen, Orbs is the 2nd more popular use-case with the most active notifications!

### Call for Community Feedback

It’s great to see so many Orbs Delegators making use of the notification app, and we already received feedback from app users who reached out to us with some excellent input and suggestions for improvements. Therefore, we thought it would be a good idea to get additional feedback from the rest of the community.

[FORM](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ZtFQB6Jo92DEvr7SQbTANSLHZoptdwLGjn2qiSq3JhM/prefill)

Any feedback is valuable and can help us improve the app for all users! 

Exceptional responses, such as those that lead to bug fixes or noteworthy improvement in the app, will earn its submitter a gift voucher to the Orbs [merchandize shop](https://orbs.myspreadshop.com/) at the discretion of the Orbs team.
