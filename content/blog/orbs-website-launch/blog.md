**Orbs is excited to announce the launch of the new Orbs website!**

After a lot of hard work and dedication, the new and improved Orbs website is finally ready. The new website contains everything you need to know about the Orbs project coupled with spectacular design.

Having a clear and concise website is extremely important as it serves as a focal point of information and content for community members, as well as anybody new to Orbs.

So what are you waiting for?! Check out the new website here:

### A Dazzling New Homepage!

The team went all-in on the WOW factor with the new website homepage!

Orbs is a fully-operational public blockchain with a decentralized pool of validator nodes. The globe in the new website homepage represents the functional, global network that is Orbs, ever growing with the expansion of its ecosystem.

As the globe rotates, look for the pop-up cards!
Each card contains an interesting piece of information about the Orbs network.

### Updated Content In Multiple Languages

The new website has all the up-to-date information about the Orbs project, under the “Overview” section in the main menu. In this section you will find 2 main things:

- A general overview of the Orbs network, including a general description of the project, its characteristics, technological innovations, as well as the basic details of the Orbs architecture and smart contracts.

- The Orbs PoS V2: The Age of Guardians, where you can learn about the Orbs PoS mechanism and features, the different roles, and how to participate.

The content is summarized in a clear and accessible manner so that anyone would be able to understand the basics of the Orbs project, even those without a strong technological background. Of course, more high-level documentation is readily available for those wishing to take a deeper dive into the more technical aspects.

In addition, the website also has a new FAQ page as well as many other small surprises.

Of course, we did not neglect our amazing Korean and Japanese Orbs communities, and the new website is available also in the Korean and Japanese languages.

### All The Resources You Need In One Place

Another important part of the new website is the “Resources” section, where you can find all the tools you need in order to interact with the Orbs network. These include, for example, Tetra: the official Orbs staking wallet, the Orbs network status page, Orbs PoS analytics dashboard, staking calculator, and many more.
