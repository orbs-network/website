Hey everyone!

As you probably know, Orbs [recently announced](https://www.orbs.com/introducing-locking-when-staking-orbs/) its new and improved staking mechanism, and a staking wallet Tetra was developed with a convenient interface to simplify the interaction with the contract. Tetra enables ORBS holders to stake their tokens and easily select a Guardian to delegate them to. As with many popular crypto wallets for ERC tokens, Tetra staking requires a MetaMask configured with your ORBS.

**Setting up MetaMask is very simple, [hereâ€™s a short tutorial on how to do it](https://www.orbs.com/tetra-orbs-staking-wallet-tutorial/)**

### **_Why does Orbs recommend MetaMask?_**

[Metamask](https://metamask.io/), supported by leading web browsers, is a secure, industry-standard wallet for interaction with Ethereum contracts. MetaMask is trusted by more than a million users worldwide, making one of the most popular Ethereum wallets. The MetaMask wallet is [highly recommended](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/7-of-the-best-ethereum-wallets/) as one of the best Ethereum wallets available.

### **_What makes MetaMask more secure?_**

MetaMask is a **non-custodial wallet**, interacting directly with the Ethereum blockchain.

A non-custodial wallet is a decentralized type of wallet, where the customer owns its private keys. When setting up MetaMask, the user gets a file with private keys and needs to write down a seed phrase with which they will be able to restore their funds. Having private keys means that you have full control over the funds.

For added security, MetaMask supports hardware wallets (like Ledger and Trezor): Hardware wallets can protect your funds even in the event of a computer hack, making MetaMask among the safest options available.

By using MetaMask which is a non-custodial wallet, Tetra ensures that Orbs Delegators are always in control of their ORBS tokens, [unlike other staking wallets that can steal users' funds](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/62456/a-chinese-eos-based-wallet-app-reportedly-shuts-down-its-platform-and-runs-away-with-52m-user-funds).
