**We are excited to announce that the Orbs network is now one of the sponsors for the Chainlink Reference Data Networks!**

Following the successful integration of the Chainlink Price Feeds into the Orbs Liquidity Nexus protocol, Orbs has been accepted as a sponsor of Chainlink’s USD pairs, and also specifically the ETH/USD pair, Reference Data Networks.

Chainlink Reference Data Networks is the market-leading standard for providing highly reliable data to smart contracts, made up of the largest collection of sybil resistant oracle node operators currently available on any blockchain. Chainlink Reference Data Networks has consistently provided highly accurate, highly reliable, and decentralized market price data using a large pool of secure node operators that serve a growing list of Price Reference Data Contracts.

### Orbs Integrates Chainlink Price Feeds to Secure Single-Sided Farming Against Flash Loan Attacks

This sponsorship is another step forward in the collaboration between Chainlink and the Orbs team. In this recent Liquidity Nexus [blog post](/orbs-integrates-chainlink-price-feeds-to-secure-single-sided-farming-against-flash-loan-attacks), we discussed at length and provided simulations of possible attack scenarios and exploits originating with a flash loan to artificially manipulate the ETH/USD price.

The blog also showcases the solution used to solve this issue – integrating the Chainlink Price Feeds market data as a robust market data source from many independent premium data aggregators, who each generate a volume-weighted average price across the entire crypto trading market.

Following this successful integration, Chainlink has now decided to add Orbs as an official Price Feed sponsor.

### About Liquidity Nexus by Orbs

Orbs have been very active in the DeFi space in the last year and is now launching its first public DeFi product under [https://nexus.orbs.com/](https://nexus.orbs.com/).

Utilizing our expertise in bridging the gaps between the centralized world and the new decentralized one, Orbs recently introduced the concept of the Orbs Liquidity Nexus. The Orbs Liquidity Nexus creates a pathway for CeFi-sourced liquidity to enter DeFi by matching their capital denominated in stablecoins to that of crypto natives denominated in more volatile cryptocurrencies, and combining those to engage in yield farming strategies that neither would be able to access on their own.

This project, and other similar ideas that could be developed on Orbs, have the potential to solve many of the obstacles currently facing the broader world of DeFi as it expands, while also bringing significant value and usage to the Orbs Network itself.

For more detail on the Orbs Liquidity Nexus and the vision of single-sided farming, see the following blog posts:
