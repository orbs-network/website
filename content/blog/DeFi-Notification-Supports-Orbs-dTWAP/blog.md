The Open DeFi Notifications Protocol has integrated Orbs’ newest layer-3 use case, [dTWAP](https://www.orbs.com/Introducing-TWAP-for-DEXs/) (decentralized time-weighted average price). dTWAP is a fully-functioning TWAP order type that is completely decentralized and made for DEXs.  

Traders using dTWAP can now be notified in real time when a dTWAP order has been completed. 

[The Open DeFi Notification Protocol](https://defi.org/notifications/) App is available on both [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp).

_The Open DeFi Notification Protocol by [defi.org](https://defi.org/) is a community led initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events._


### The Best Way to Monitor Your dTWAP Orders

Recently, Orbs unveiled its newest Layer-3 use case, dTWAP, allowing DEX traders to execute fully decentralized TWAP order types. This protocol was recently [integrated](https://www.orbs.com/SpiritSwap-Integrates-dTWAP-Order-Powered-by-Orbs/) with Spiritswap and has been fully functional since. 

dTWAP is an algorithmic trading order that divides a trading order into a number of smaller trades and executes these trades at regular intervals over a specified period of time. It enables DEX users to execute more sophisticated trading orders such as price impact reduction and DCA (dollar cost averaging).

Using the Open DeFi Notification Protocol, Orb dTWAP traders can set up either an **“Order complete”** notification or an **“all events notification”**. This will issue an alert when dTWAP orders have been filled, or if selecting the latter, a notification will be issued on any events that happen during the order. In this way, users have 24/7 monitoring of the status of their positions and can take the necessary actions to manage them as needed.

### A Notification Standard for Leading DeFi Projects

The Open DeFi Notification Protocol is an open initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events. 

The addition of dTWAP adds to the impressive lineup of leading DeFi projects that have already been integrated into the Open DeFi Notification app for the benefit of their users, including, among others: Aave, Uniswap, StakeDAO, [Harvest Finance](https://www.orbs.com/The-Open-DeFi-Notification-Protocol-Now-Supports-Harvest-Finance/), [Frax Finance](https://www.orbs.com/DeFi-Notification-Supports-Frax-Finance/) and more…

**All in all, the app supports over 20 protocols across 5 networks: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Fantom and Avalanche!**
