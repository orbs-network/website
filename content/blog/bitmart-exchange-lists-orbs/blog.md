The listing follows Orbs' active developments both offline and online. Last week both Ran Hammer VP of Business Development, and Tal Kol co-founder and CTO spoke at [Zebu Live](https://twitter.com/orbs_network/status/1709940918487515407), the largest web3 event in London. This shortly trailed dTWAP and Limit orders on Base chain for the first time via [BaseSwap](https://twitter.com/BaseSwap_Fi/status/1708913343912718686) integration and [Orbs Liquidity Hub on QuickSwap](https://twitter.com/orbs_network/status/1703755898336813298). Both products are redefining the decentralized exchange landscape as major players continue to support these new features.
