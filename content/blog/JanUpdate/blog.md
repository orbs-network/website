**Orbs Introduces Multi-chain Staking Proposal**

ðŸ”¹The Orbs team proposed utilizing Orbs' hybrid architecture and cross-chain properties to deploy multi-chain Orbs PoS staking, adding Polygon to the existing staking on Ethereum.

ðŸ”¹The multi-chain staking solution proposed by the team is expected to completely mitigate the current high Ethereum gas costs for Orbs delegators interacting with the Orbs staking contracts.

ðŸ”¹The end result will, if accepted by the ecosystem, allow Orbs Delegators to have the ability to choose between staking on Ethereum and staking on Polygon, based on their own personal preferences and considerations.

ðŸ”¹Having the Orbs governance mechanism deployed on multiple chains is a revolutionary and bold move by the Orbs project which conforms with Orbs vision of interoperability across the crypto space.

ðŸ”¹Right after the proposal release, top media sources featured the event.

**The Open DeFi Notification Protocol, powered by Orbs, Launches Public Beta!**

![](/assets/img/blog/JanUpdate-images/image2.jpg)

ðŸ”¹The Open DeFi Notification Protocol is a community inspired initiative spearheaded by DeFi.org, to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for crucial on-chain events:

âœ… Free for use --- no subscription fees or ads!

âœ… Dependable --- never miss an alert

âœ… Multi network support --- Ethereum, BSC, Polygon and more

âœ… Community-led and open --- public and decentralized alert nodes

ðŸ”¹We believe that real-time DeFi notifications are a critical piece of the DeFi infrastructure puzzle and its impact on the industry will be massive.

ðŸ”¹Orbs is excited to be the first project to implement the protocol and contribute to the success of this initiative as part of Orbs' Layer-3 innovation!

ðŸ”¹The Open DeFi Notification Protocol is now available on both [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp). You're welcome to check it out and try it for yourself.

ðŸ”¹Right after the launch, top media sources featured the launch. Read more on: [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2022-01-25/defi-org-launches-the-open-defi-notification-protocol-powered-by-the-orbs-network), [Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/defi-org-launches-open-defi-123000053.html#:~:text=Newsfile-,DeFi.org%20Launches%20the%20Open%20DeFi%20Notification%20Protocol%20Powered%20by,Newsfile%20Corp.&text=Orbs%20ushers%20in%20the%20next,on%20Apple%20and%20iOS%20devices), [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/defi.org-launches-the-open-defi-notification-protocol-powered-by-the-orbs-network).

**QuickSwap Launches a Dragon's Syrup Pool for Orbs**

![](/assets/img/blog/JanUpdate-images/image5.jpg)

ðŸ”¹One of the first Orbs integrations was with Polygon. It has been accomplished by bridging the ORBS token into Polygon, and then integrating the bridged Orbs token with QuickSwap, the Polygon DeFi ecosystem's biggest and most active DEX-AMM.

ðŸ”¹Next, the Orbs Dragon Syrup Pool on QuickSwap went [live](https://twitter.com/orbs_network/status/1483507403811401734?cxt=HHwWjMC5nfaHvZYpAAAA)! The "Dragon's Syrup" program by QuickSwap enables $QUICK token stakers to earn extra rewards by staking their $dQUICK (the asset you receive when you deposit your Quick into the staking contract) to earn tokens that are traded on the DEX.

ðŸ”¹To make things simple: you can now stake your dQUICK to earn ORBS tokens under 'Farms -> [Dragon's Syrup' tab](https://quickswap.exchange/#/syrup).
