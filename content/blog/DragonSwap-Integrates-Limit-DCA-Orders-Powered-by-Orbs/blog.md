**DragonSwap, the premier DEX on the Sei Network, has integrated the dLIMIT and DCA protocols powered by Orbs, enhancing its DeFi ecosystem with advanced trading functionalities!**

As a result, DragonSwap traders now have access to both advanced order types, enabling them to either lock in the price of their trades or split large orders into smaller trades. This integration follows successful implementations with other prominent DEXs, further solidifying Orbs' position as the go-to solution for advanced DeFi orders and showcasing its unique layer 3 technology, which brings CeFi-level execution capabilities to DeFi.

dLIMIT is a fully decentralized, permissionless, and composable DeFi protocol developed by Orbs and powered by the Orbs Network. In addition to Limit orders, DragonSwap will also integrate decentralized dollar cost average price orders (DCA) by Orbs, supporting this widely-used algorithmic trading strategy.

_Orbs operates as a decentralized protocol managed by a public network of permissionless validators using PoS, with tens of millions of dollars staked in TVL. The protocol enhances on-chain trading with L3 use cases like aggregated liquidity, advanced trading orders, and decentralized derivatives, bringing an efficient CeFi-like trading experience to DeFi._

### Trade with CeFi-level execution on a DEX

In the past month, DragonSwap supported a transaction volume of over $150 million dollars at the time of writing. dLIMIT & DCA will expand DragonSwap’s current offerings, potentially opening up another avenue for the project to increase trading volumes. 

For those who are unfamiliar, a Limit order allows users to buy or sell tokens at a specific price. While the specified price is guaranteed, the execution of the order is not and depends on price movement. Limit orders will only be executed if the market price meets the order specifications.

A DCA order is a trading strategy that aims to reduce the impact of buying an asset all at once by breaking the order down into smaller portions that are then executed over time. By executing smaller orders, this approach minimizes the price volatility and gradually enables traders to acquire various assets over a specific period. In crypto, this is particularly useful as prices are constantly changing.

**DragonSwap’s traders can now utilize these key traditional finance orders without sacrificing decentralization.**


### Setting up a dLIMIT and DCA orders


When switching to a dLIMIT ‘swap’ on DragonSwap, users are presented with an easy-to-follow user interface alongside an order history tab to keep track of previous transactions. 

Before executing a dLIMIT order, traders must specify the following: 

1. **From:** The token that they currently have
2. **To:** The token that they wish to swap for
3. **Limit price:** Trades will ONLY be executed when the available market price is equal to or better than the Limit price.

dLIMIT takes into account current market conditions, prices, and gas fees. Once the parameters are set, the user can approve the specific source token, place the order, and review their order live in the ‘order history’ tab.

For a DCA order, three additional parameters need to be specified:

- **No. of Intervals [over]:** allows the user to specify the number of individual trades. The UI automatically calculates the total number of transactions required to complete the entire order and the estimated trading interval.
- **Trade Interval [every]:** sets the time gap between each individual trade. The user can edit this parameter, which also results in changes to the corresponding trade size and number parameters.


Similarly to dLIMIT, these parameters provide incredible flexibility in customizing each order, taking into account factors like market conditions and current gas fees. Additionally, the UI facilitates both DCA-market orders, which execute all trades at the available market price, and DCA-Limit orders, which only execute individual trades if they are within the price Limit set by the user. Once these parameters are set, the user can approve the specific source token, place the order, and confirm their specified configuration.

### Redefining Trading Standards on Decentralized Exchanges


The dLIMIT & DCA protocols, powered by Orbs [L3 technology](https://www.orbs.com/overview/), have become the industry standard for decentralized algorithmic orders in DeFi. The ‘powered by Orbs branding’ has become a staple of confidence when executing advance orders on decentralized venues.

Together with its other products: [Liquidity Hub](https://www.orbs.com/liquidity-hub/) for aggregated liquidity and [Perpetual Hub](https://www.orbs.com/perpetual-hub/) for decentralized on-chain perpetual futures, Orbs protocols have been implemented by 15 prominent DEXs spanning 9 chains.
