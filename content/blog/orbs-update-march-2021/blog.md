Orbs and Flipsidecrypto announced that they have teamed up to launch the Orbs Community Console.

[**The Orbs Community Console**](https://orbs.flipsidecrypto.com/) displays and highlights key performance indicators for the Orbs network, by tracking relevant on-chain metrics to decode stakeholder behavior and drive network growth. The Orbs Community Console will assist team and community members alike with learning which specific activities are driving growth on the Orbs network and understand metrics that are not just limited to price and market cap.
