**The Open DeFi Notifications Protocol has integrated [Stake DAO](https://stakedao.org/), a revenue-sharing DAO on Ethereum, with over $53.4M in TVL.** 

Stake DAO users can now be notified on their smartphone when a specified amount of SDT is ready to claim.

[The Open DeFi Notification Protocol](https://defi.org/notifications/) App is available on both [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp).

_The Open DeFi Notification Protocol by [defi.org](https://defi.org/) is a community led initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events._


### The Best Way to Monitor Your Rewards

Stake DAO is a non-custodial platform that enables anyone to grow their crypto portfolio easily. It is built on top of decentralized blockchain protocols, offering a seamless way for people to grow, track, and control assets right from their wallets.

Users on Stake DAO can lock their tokens for x amount of time in return for the veSDT governance token. To achieve the compounding APY users must manually restake their yield, thus making them a perfect fit for notifications to help stakers maximize their return.

Using the Open DeFi Notification Protocol, Stake DAO users can set up a **“Pending Reward”** notification. This will issue an alert when farmers reach a specified amount of $SDT that can be claimed. In this way, users have 24/7 monitoring of the status of their positions and can take the necessary actions to manage them as needed.

### A Notification Standard for Leading DeFi Projects

The Open DeFi Notification Protocol is an open initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events. 

The addition of Stake DAO adds to the impressive lineup of leading DeFi projects that have already been integrated into the Open DeFi Notification app for the benefit of their users, including, among others: Aave, Uniswap, SushiSwap, [Harvest Finance](https://www.orbs.com/The-Open-DeFi-Notification-Protocol-Now-Supports-Harvest-Finance/), [Frax Finance](https://www.orbs.com/DeFi-Notification-Supports-Frax-Finance/) and more…

**All in all, the app supports over 20 protocols across 5 networks: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Fantom and Avalanche!**
