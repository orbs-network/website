**GOPAX exchange has officially announced the listing of $ORBS, the native token of the Orbs network!**

GOPAX, established in 2016, is one of five certified KRW cryptocurrency exchanges, supporting 91 trading pairs and 78 different assets. GOPAX is a fast, reliable, technology-oriented virtual asset (cryptocurrency) exchange by Streami Inc.

GOPAX, a spot-only exchange, offers a sophisticated trading toolset and boasts its KRW trading certification, which for those unfamiliar, is a very difficult status to acquire in South Korea. The listing is a reflection of the  Orbs Network’s strong community and participation levels in Korea.

The listing decision by GOPAX follows a series of developments around the Orbs Networks. Orbs and Polygon recently [launched](https://defi.org/announcements/orbs-polygon-announce-a-special-round-of-the-defi-org-accelerator/) a special round of the DeFi.org Accelerator. In addition, Orbs has officially announced its [collaboration](https://www.orbs.com/Expanding-to-The-Open-Network-TON/) with TON - The Open Network, as part of its ecosystem expansion. Last month, [Huobi](https://twitter.com/HuobiGlobal/status/1579328457175363585) listed the Orbs token  and the Orbs token as added to [OKX staking](https://www.orbs.com/OKX-Announces-ORBS-Staking/#:~:text=By%20facilitating%20ORBS%20staking%2C%20OKX,public%2C%20permissionless%20blockchain%20infrastructure%20project.) page. Lastly, the decentralized TWAP protocol, an innovative new DeFi product powered by the Orbs Network’s L3 technology, is in the process of being integrated with [SpiritSwap](https://twitter.com/orbs_network/status/1578017484174757891).

**About Orbs**

The Orbs Network is an open, decentralized and public blockchain infrastructure executed by a secure network of permissionless validators using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus.

Orbs is set up as a separate decentralized execution layer operating between existing L1/L2 solutions and the application layer, as part of a tiered blockchain stack, without moving liquidity onto a new chain. Orbs acts as a “decentralized backend”, enhancing the capabilities of existing smart contracts and opening up a whole new spectrum of possibilities for Web 3.0, DeFi, NFTs and GameFi.

Orbs was founded in 2017 and launched its mainnet and token in March of 2019. Orbs is being developed by a dedicated team of more than 30 people, with offices in Tel Aviv, London, New York, Tokyo and Seoul.
