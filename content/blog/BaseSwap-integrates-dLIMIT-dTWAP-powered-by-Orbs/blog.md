**BaseSwap, one of the largest native DEXs on Base, has integrated the [dLimit](https://www.orbs.com/Introducing-dLIMIT-for-DEXs/) & [dTWAP](https://www.orbs.com/dtwap/) protocol powered by Orbs! Expanding dTWAP and dLIMIT advanced trading orders to Base!**

As a result, BaseSwap traders will now have access to both advanced order types, enabling traders to guarantee the price of their order or break up large orders into smaller trades. This development follows successful integrations with other prominent DEXs including QuickSwap, SpookySwap, Thena, and more. With each integration, dLIMIT and dTWAP further solidify Orbs' position as a market leader in DeFi innovation, showcasing Orbs’ novel [layer 3 technology](https://www.orbs.com/overview/) for pushing the boundaries of smart contract technology.

dLIMIT is a fully decentralized, permissionless, and composable DeFi protocol developed by the Orbs project and powered by the Orbs network. BaseSwap traders will now have access to the advanced order types at no extra cost. Furthermore, in addition to dLIMIT, BaseSwap will also integrate decentralized time-weighted average price orders (dTWAP) by Orbs, enabling execution of this commonly used algorithmic trading strategy.

_[Orbs](https://www.orbs.com/) is a decentralized protocol executed by a public network of permissionless validators using PoS, staked with TVL valued at over a hundred million dollars. Orbs pioneers the concept of L3 infrastructure, by utilizing the Orbs decentralized network to enhance the capabilities of existing EVM smart contracts, opening up a whole new spectrum of possibilities for Web 3.0, DeFi, NFTs, and GameFi._


### Trade DeFi like a Pro

BaseSwap is the 2nd largest native DEX on Base at the time of writing. dLIMIT & dTWAP will expand DEX’s current offerings, potentially opening up another avenue for the project to increase trading volumes. 

For those who are unfamiliar, a Limit order allows users to buy or sell tokens at a specific price or better. While the specified price is guaranteed, the execution of the order is not and depends on price movement. Limit orders will only be executed if the market price meets the order specifications.

In contrast, a TWAP order is an algorithmic trading strategy that aims to reduce the impact of large orders on the market by breaking them down into smaller portions that are then executed over time. By executing smaller orders, this approach lessens the price impact and enables traders to gradually acquire various assets over a specific period. In DeFi this is particularly useful as pools need time to rebalance.

BaseSwap’s traders can now utilize both of these key traditional finance orders without sacrificing decentralization. 


### Setting up a dLIMIT and dTWAP orders

When switching to a dLIMIT ‘swap’ on [BaseSwap](https://baseswap.fi/swap), users are presented with an easy-to-follow user interface alongside an order history tab to keep track of previous transactions. 

Before executing a dLIMIT order, traders must specify the following: 

- **From:** The token that they currently have 
- **To:** The token that they wish to swap for
- **Limit price:** Trades will ONLY be executed when the available market price is equal to or better than the Limit price.

dLIMIT takes into account current market conditions, prices, and gas fees. Once the parameters are set, the user can approve the specific source token, place the order, and review their order live in the ‘order history’ tab.

For a dTWAP order, three additional parameters need to be specified:

- **No. of Intervals:** allows the user to specify the number of individual trades. The UI automatically calculates the total number of transactions required to complete the entire order and the estimated trading interval.
- **Max Duration:** the maximum time during which the total amount of individual trades making up the full dTWAP order may be executed.
- **Trade Interval:** sets the time gap between each individual trade. The user can edit this parameter, which also results in changes to the corresponding trade size and number parameters.


Similarly to dLIMIT, these parameters provide incredible flexibility in customizing each order, taking into account factors like market conditions and current gas fees. Additionally, the UI facilitates both dTWAP-market orders, which execute all trades at the available market price, and dTWAP-Limit orders, which only execute individual trades if they are within the price Limit set by the user. Once these parameters are set, the user can approve the specific source token, place the order, and confirm their specified configuration.

### Redefining Trading Standards on Decentralized Exchanges

The dLIMIT & dTWAP protocol, powered by Orbs L3 technology, has become the industry standard for decentralized algorithmic orders in DeFi. The ‘powered by Orbs branding’ has become a staple of confidence when executing advance orders on decentralized venues.

To date, the protocol has been implemented by 7 prominent DEXs spanning 5 chains.
