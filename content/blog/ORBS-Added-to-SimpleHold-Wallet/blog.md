### SimpleHold - Your Pass to the Crypto Universe

[SimpleHold](https://simplehold.io/) is a light wallet that was created by the SimpleSwap team with a main focus on safety and usability, supporting more than 50 cryptocurrencies.

The SimpleHold wallet is designed to seamlessly connect users to the crypto and DeFi world in a secure and safe manner, offering the following key features:

- **Secure:** AES-encrypted backups to guarantee safety of your private keys.
- **Transparent:** Open source code available on GitHub.
- **Private:** No access to keys, addresses or transactions.
- **Light:** Only the user can manage your crypto, no third-parties.

In addition, SimpleHold supports token swaps using the built-in SimpleSwap app, as well as easy storage of NFTs and hardware wallet support.


### A Variety to Choose From

The Orbs community plays a vital role in the success of the Orbs project and therefore it is important to ensure  that the ORBS token is as accessible as possible for existing and new ORBS token holders. Having Orbs integrated into leading crypto wallets is an important step towards achieving that goal.

**About Orbs**

The Orbs Network is an open, decentralized and public blockchain infrastructure executed by a secure network of permissionless validators using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus.

Orbs is set up as a separate decentralized execution layer operating between existing L1/L2 solutions and the application layer, as part of a tiered blockchain stack, without moving liquidity onto a new chain. Orbs acts as a “decentralized backend”, enhancing the capabilities of existing smart contracts and opening up a whole new spectrum of possibilities for Web 3.0, DeFi, NFTs and GameFi.
