**We are thrilled to announce that the ORBS token is live on Pangolin, a new community-driven decentralized exchange for Avalanche and Ethereum assets!**

[Pangolin](https://pangolin.exchange/), which runs on Avalanche, uses the same automated market-making (AMM) model as Uniswap, features a native governance token called PNG that is fully community distributed and is capable of trading all tokens issued on Ethereum and Avalanche.

In a crowded marketplace with multiple contenders, Pangolin offers community-driven development, as well as a democratic token distribution.

### Ecosystem & Liquidity

So, what should we know about Pangolin and its integration with Orbs?

Pangolin Exchange is a decentralized automated market maker powered by the Avalanche network. It supports assets on both Ethereum and Avalanche and is considered to be the second biggest project on the Avalanche main net, which enables its users to benefit from  its community traction. Pangolin uses the same automated market making model as Uniswap and is able to trade any token issued either on the Ethereum or Avalanche network.

In addition to positioning itself a community-committed project - the native governance token, PNG, enables the community to drive the development of the product in full - Pangolin is partnering with such DeFi and NFT projects as Ape In, OpenOcean, YAY Games, as well as decentralized interoperability networks and aggregators as Alexar and ParaSwap that altogether make Pangolin a nice addition to Orbs ecosystem.

When coupled with the Avalanche-Ethereum bridge, Pangolin empowers DeFi users to pursue yield opportunities with the same asset across two blockchains. 

**In addition, Avalanche users can now swap and add liquidity to Orbs pools on Pangolin.**

Pangolin’s liquidity mining program starts on mainnet launch and aims to cover AVAX Pools and PNG Pools.

Pangolin’s major goal is to try to respond to these two critical issues that other AMMs face: subpar performance and governance controls that benefit a few large holders. Pangolin claims its users experience centralized-exchange-like speeds without having to compromise access to their existing portfolio of assets and without having to give control to large insiders.


The Avalanche network is one of the most rapidly expanding DeFi ecosystems, offering a lot of untapped potential. Orbs has already completed successful integrations with Trader Joe and now Pangolin, which enable users to create new liquidity pools and increase trading volume. More exciting news coming soon!
