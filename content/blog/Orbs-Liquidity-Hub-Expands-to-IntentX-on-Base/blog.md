**IntentX, a decentralized intent-based perpetual platform, has integrated Orbs Liquidity Hub as its main spot engine!**

As a result, IntentX users will now have access to spot orders in addition to the thriving perp marketplace. The liquidity is sourced from Liquidity Hub by Orbs, aggregating both on- and off-chain sources to achieve competitive pricing. 

This collaboration marks the fourth deployment of Liquidity Hub and the first on Coinbase’s L2 chain, Base. Perhaps more significantly, it marks a new phase of Liquidity Hub and how it’s integrated. This is the first integration _without_ a DEX AMM, IntentX has purely integrated the Hub for the sole purpose of aggregating liquidity. 

Liquidity Hub stands as a hallmark of innovation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, conceptualized and built by the Orbs project. It operates on the principles of complete decentralization, open access without permissions, and composability. Thanks to this integration, traders on Base utilizing IntentX can now tap into the full liquidity potential offered by the network, without incurring any additional costs.

_[Orbs](https://www.orbs.com/) is a decentralized protocol executed by a public network of permissionless validators using PoS, staked with tens of millions of dollars in TVL. Orbs pioneers the concept of L3 infrastructure, by utilizing the Orbs decentralized network to enhance the capabilities of existing EVM smart contracts, opening up a whole new spectrum of possibilities for Web 3.0, DeFi, NFTs, and GameFi._

### How Liquidity Hub Works

Liquidity Hub is a DeFi infrastructure project aggregating all of the deployed chain's liquidity and adding in additional sources from off-chain. 

Instead of the typical swap on a DEX, Liquidity Hub instead sources from:

- **On-chain solver auction:** Third-party solvers who compete to fill swaps using on-chain liquidity like AMM pools or their own private inventory.

- **Decentralized orders via API:** Decentralized orders are accessible using API, enabling institutional/professional traders, such as market makers, to submit bids and compete to fill swaps.

### Continuing the Standard 

The Liquidity Hub protocol, powered by Orbs [L3 technology](https://www.orbs.com/overview/), has become the industry standard for achieving the best price across ecosystems. 

To date, the protocol has previously been implemented by Quickswap on polygon, Quickswap on polygon zkEVM, and THENA on BNB chain.
