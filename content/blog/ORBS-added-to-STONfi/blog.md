**oORBS (the [Orbit bridge](https://www.orbs.com/ORBS-available-on-Orbit-Bridge-and-Megaton-Finance-DEX/) token of ORBS), has been listed by STON.fi, a major DEX on The Open Network (TON).** 

[STON.fi](https://ston.fi/) is a decentralized automated market maker (AMM) built on the TON blockchain providing cheap fees, low slippage, an intuitive interface, and direct integration with TON wallets. oORBS is now listed on DEX, with about $50K in liquidity for seamless swaps between TON/oORBS.

This listing further integrates Orbs with the TON ecosystem and allows the growing number of participants in TON to acquire Orbs’ native token, without needing to bridge to Ethereum. 

STON.fi offers the following benefits to traders:

- Fully decentralized system. All transactions are made directly between traders and do not require a third party. 
- Low trading fees (0.3%). STON.fi runs on the TON blockchain with much lower transaction costs and higher speed compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchains.
- Front running is not an issue at STON.fi due to the advanced sharding and async nature of the TON blockchain. 

The integration of oOrbs with STON.fi follows a series of growing developments in the ecosystem. At the end of January Orbs announced its participation in [hack-a-TONx](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/hack-a-tonx/). Orbs will be hosting exclusive TON events in [Tel Aviv](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/first-ever-ton-telegram-hackathon-tlv-tickets-515959156727?aff=ebdssbdestsearch) and [London](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/first-ever-ton-telegram-hackathon-tlv-tickets-515959156727?aff=ebdssbeac) later this month. Earlier in January, Verifier was named an [official tool](https://www.orbs.com/TON-Verifier-added-to-TONorg/) of The Open Network, following behind [Minter](https://www.orbs.com/Announcing-TON-Minter-by-Orbs/) the month prior.  

The STON.fi team has also mentioned to Orbs that they recognize the advantages of [TON Access](https://www.orbs.com/ton-access/) and are considering it for future product updates of their dApp.

**About Orbs**

The Orbs Network is an open, decentralized and public blockchain infrastructure executed by a secure network of permissionless validators using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus.

 Orbs is set up as a separate decentralized execution layer operating between existing L1/L2 solutions and the application layer, as part of a tiered blockchain stack, without moving liquidity onto a new chain. Orbs acts as a “decentralized backend”, enhancing the capabilities of existing smart contracts and opening up a whole new spectrum of possibilities for Web 3.0, DeFi, NFTs and GameFi.

Orbs was founded in 2017 and launched its mainnet and token in March of 2019. Orbs is being developed by a dedicated team of more than 30 people, with team members in Tel Aviv, London, New York, Tokyo and Seoul.
