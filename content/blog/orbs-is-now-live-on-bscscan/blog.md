**We are excited to announce that the ORBS token is now available on BscScan, the Binance Smart Chain explorer.**

BscScan is the leading block explorer for the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), allowing users to easily lookup, confirm and validate transactions that have taken place on the BSC blockchain, similar to how [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) is used for the Ethereum Network.

In a [recent post](/orbs-is-now-live-on-binance-smart-chain-via-anyswap-cross-chain-bridge) we announced that the ORBS token is now available on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) using [multichain.xyz](https://multichain.xyz/) by Anyswap as a cross-chain bridge between Ethereum and BSC. Following that successful integration, Orbs is now officially part of the BSC ecosystem as a BEP-20 token.

As a result, Orbs can now be tracked on the BSC blockchain using the BscScan explorer!

### Orbs Contract on BSC

The official ORBS token contract address on Binance Smart Chain is:

[https://bscscan.com/token/0xebd49b26169e1b52c04cfd19fcf289405df55f80](https://bscscan.com/token/0xebd49b26169e1b52c04cfd19fcf289405df55f80)

**Always verify the token address before making a transaction.**

### BSC – a Rising Star in DeFi

With the rapid growth of DeFi, BSC has been quick to take action, attempting to improve on some of Ethereum’s most acute pains at the moment such as transaction fees and transaction speed.

In the last couple of months, we are seeing more and more DeFi alternatives growing on BSC such as PancakeSwap (DEX), Venus (lending), autofarm.network (vault), and more. In addition, native support for EVM (same smart contract engine as Ethereum) and cross-chain bridges (such as multichain.xyz), allow for easy migration of projects to BSC.

To date, the BSC ecosystem has a Total Value Locked (TVL) of approximately $30B, according to [DEFISTATION](https://www.defistation.io/). In comparison, the Ethereum [DeFi ecosystem](https://defipulse.com/) holds just over $55B in TVL.

## Explore more about Orbs and BSC

In the last couple of months, Orbs has made a significant move into the DeFi space. This includes integration to most of the popular DeFi applications on the Ethereum Network, such as [Uniswap](https://blog.orbsdefi.com/p/orbs-on-uniswap-and-whats-next), [SushiSwap](/orbs-is-now-live-on-sushiswap), [1inch](/orbs-is-now-live-on-1inch-exchange), and many more. In addition, Orbs recently revealed its flagship project: [Liquidity Nexus](https://nexus.orbs.com/) which aims to bring CeFi into the DeFi space.

As discussed above, BSC has become a significant player in the DeFi space, one not to be overlooked. Here are some of the current projects Orbs is working on with regards to the Binance DeFi ecosystem. More updates to be released soon!

### DeFi.org accelerator

On January 11, Orbs and Binance exchange [announced](https://www.binance.org/en/blog/orbs-and-binance-team-up-to-launch-defi-accelerator/) that they are teaming up to promote innovation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space by serving as the first core sponsors of the [DeFi.org](DeFi.org) accelerator, which bootstraps new projects and DeFi protocols.

### Orbs Live on PancakeSwap

[PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/) is the most popular DEX/AMM on BSC. It is very similar to Uniswap and SushiSwap and was actually one of the first forks of Uniswap that was deployed to BSC. PancakeSwap is also the number one protocol on BSC in terms of TVL according to DefiStation, with a Total Value Locked (TVL) of just under $10B (!!).

**Orbs and PancakeSwap [recently](/orbs-launches-a-syrup-pool-on-pancakeswap) launched the Orbs Syrup Pool.**

The Orbs Syrup pool on PancakeSwap enables Orbs liquidity providers to farm CAKE tokens and in addition, stake CAKE tokens to earn additional ORBS.

This initiative is an important first milestone to gain a stronger foothold for Orbs on Binance Smart Chain.
