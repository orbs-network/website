In a [recent](https://www.orbs.com/Orbs-is-Live-on-the-Solana-Wormhole-Bridge/) blog post we announced that Orbs is now available on Solana, using Solana’s Wormhole cross-chain [bridge](https://wormholebridge.com/#/).

After bridging the ORBS token into Solana, the next step is to integrate it with Solana’s leading DeFi ecosystem - one of the most exciting DeFi ecosystems in the crypto-verse at the moment.

Well…

### Raydium: The Next Evolution of DeFi

[Raydium](https://raydium.io/) is an automated market maker (AMM) built on the Solana blockchain which enables lightning-fast trades, shared liquidity and new features for earning yield.

Raydium leverages the efficiency of the Solana blockchain to achieve faster and cheaper transactions. In addition, Raydium shares the central order book of the [Serum DEX](https://projectserum.com/#/), meaning that Raydium allows access to the order flow and liquidity of the entire Serum ecosystem.

Raydium has a Total Value Locked of over $2B, with daily trading volume exceeding $250M.

There is currently one [Orbs pool](https://raydium.io/pools/) on Raydium for ORBS-SOL, with a total liquidity of ~$57K.

### Orbs: A Multi-chain Token


**With this first major integration into Solana, Orbs is now live on all five major chains: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Avalanche and Solana!**

Solana is the fifth Layer-1 blockchain infrastructure integration, with Raydium serving as the first major platform. 

Solana is emerging as a leading layer-1 blockchain infrastructure project, quickly closing the gap with the current market leaders. As such, Orbs is excited to start its journey on the Solana network, exploring the possibilities and opportunities it presents. Expect more news soon!
