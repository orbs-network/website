The Open DeFi Notifications Protocol has integrated with [dForce](https://dforce.network/), a protocol supporting a complete set of decentralized finance protocols covering assets, lending, and trading, serving as DeFi infrastructure in Web3. At the time of writing, dForce holds 51.39M in TVL.

dForce users can rest easy knowing that their positions are monitored 24/7 and that they will receive real-time notifications to help them manage their risk.

The [Open DeFi Notification Protocol](https://defi.org/notifications/) App is available on the [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp).

_The Open DeFi Notification Protocol by defi.org is a community led initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events._

### The Best Way to Monitor Your Loaned Assets

dForce enables its users to use a multitude of financial instruments to earn yield from their assets. dForce supports an overcollateralized soft pegged USD stablecoin, robust lending, and a trading suite integrated with Celer’s Inter-Chain Messaging. 

Lending in particular on dForce, as with any DeFi lending protocol does not come without risk. Counterparty, smart contracts, and liquidity are all required to be taken into account when interacting with lending. However, DeFi notifications help mitigate liquidation risk in particular. 

As we all know, the crypto market is very volatile. Extreme price movements can decrease the notional value of a collateral’s token or increase the value of the borrowed currency (or both), increasing the risk of liquidation. At times such as these, borrowers can experience sleepless nights, having to monitor their position status regularly.

Well, not anymore!

Using the Open DeFi Notification Protocol, dForce users can set up a **“Low Liquidity”** notification which will issue an alert when your position gets close to your specified “Adequacy Ratio.” In this way, users have 24/7 monitoring of their position status and can take immediate action in order to mitigate the risk of liquidation.

### A Notification Standard for Leading DeFi Projects

The Open DeFi Notification Protocol is an open initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events. 

Angle joins other top DeFi lending protocols, such as [Aave](https://medium.com/@defiorg/the-open-defi-notification-protocol-now-supports-aave-c544bdb89ce), [Frax](https://www.orbs.com/DeFi-Notification-Supports-Frax-Finance/), and [Alpaca Finance](https://medium.com/@defiorg/the-open-defi-notification-protocol-now-supports-alpaca-finance-c99213c5f72d), supported by the Open DeFi Notification app, with liquidation risk notifications being one of the most popular use cases by the app users.

The addition of Angle makes for an impressive lineup of leading DeFi projects who have already been integrated into the Open DeFi Notification app for the benefit of their users, including among others: Aave, Uniswap, SushiSwap, QuickSwap, PancakeSwap and more…

**All in all, the app supports over 20 protocols across 6 networks: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Fantom, Cronos and Avalanche!**
