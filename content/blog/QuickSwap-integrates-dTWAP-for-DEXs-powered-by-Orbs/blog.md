QuickSwap, the largest native DEX on Polygon, has integrated the [dTWAP protocol](https://www.orbs.com/dtwap/) powered by Orbs. As a result, the QuickSwap dragons will now have access to this algorithmic trading strategy, enabling traders to reduce the price impact of their orders. This comes after integrations with SpookySwap, Spirit, and Pangolin, growing the number of integrated DEXs as dTWAP establishes Orbs as a market leader in DeFi innovation. 

dTWAP is a fully decentralized, permissionless, and composable DeFi protocol developed by the Orbs project and powered by the Orbs network. QuickSwap traders will now have access to the advanced order type without any additional cost. Further, in addition to dTWAP, the dragons will be implementing Orbs’ infrastructure for Limit Swap orders.

The integration highlights the close technical collaboration between Orbs and QuickSwap. Both projects actively contributed to making dTWAP a reality on QuickSwap. This was possible due to the smart contract audits ([1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xUZN5RrNvszaPDJuJjfeG3ig14Vo2aaE/view),[2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ASt3_mWwtQ0IfKqBHebnj_KGJWntaNJs/view)) and the robust developer documentation of dTWAP. 

_[Orbs](https://www.orbs.com/) is a decentralized protocol executed by a public network of permissionless validators using PoS, staked with TVL valued at over a hundred million dollars. Orbs pioneers the concept of L3 infrastructure, by utilizing the Orbs decentralized network to enhance the capabilities of existing EVM smart contracts, opening up a whole new spectrum of possibilities for Web 3.0, DeFi, NFTs, and GameFi._


### Trade like a pro with dTWAP

In the past week, QuickSwap has supported a transaction volume of [$209.8 million](https://defillama.com/dexs/quickswap) dollars at the time of writing. QuickSwap’s offerings include multi-chain swaps, limit, order, and ‘best price trades.’ dTWAP will expand the DEX’s current offerings and attract higher volumes from traders looking for ways to reduce price impact. 

TWAP is an algorithmic trading strategy commonly utilized in CeFi that aims to reduce the impact of large orders on the market by breaking them down into smaller portions over time. By executing smaller orders, this approach lessens the price impact and enables traders to gradually acquire various assets over a specific period. Dragon traders can now utilize these key features without sacrificing decentralization. 

### Setting up a dTWAP order

When switching to the dTWAP UI, users are presented with a fully customizable dashboard that updates in real-time as they make changes to their orders.

Before executing dTWAP, three parameters need to be specified:

- **No. of Intervals:** allows the user to specify the number of individual trades. The UI automatically calculates the total number of transactions required to complete the entire order and the estimated trading interval.
- **Max Duration:** the maximum time during which the total amount of individual trades making up the full dTWAP order may be executed.
- **Trade Interval:** sets the time gap between each individual trade. The user can edit this parameter, which also results in corresponding trade size and number changes.

These parameters provide significant flexibility in customizing each order, taking into account factors like market conditions and current gas fees. Additionally, the UI facilitates both dTWAP-market and dTWAP-limit orders. Once these parameters are set, the user can approve the specific source token, place the order, and review their specified configuration.

### Industry-leading DeFi Innovation 

Powered by the Orbs network [L3 technology](https://www.orbs.com/overview/), the dTWAP protocol has established itself as the standard in the DeFi space for decentralized algorithmic orders. With integrations on 4 DEXs across 3 different chains, which together have facilitated a $200M+ trading volume in the past seven days, the protocol usage is expected to grow substantially as it expands support for additional DEXs. In the coming weeks, expect more updates on further collaboration between Orbs and Quickswap.
