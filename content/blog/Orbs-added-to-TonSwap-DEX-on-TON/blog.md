**The ORBS token has been added to TonSwap, a leading DEX on The Open Network (TON)!**

[TonSwap](https://tonswap.org/swap/tokens) is an up-and-coming native DEX on TON with 13 tokens (or Jettons as they are called on TON) already listed, including USDC, ETH, and BTC.

This announcement follows Orbs [recent addition](https://www.orbs.com/ORBS-available-on-Orbit-Bridge-and-Megaton-Finance-DEX/) to Orbit Bridge. Further, it solidifies Orbs integration on TON, as the ORBS token can now be bridged back and forth onto the open network using the Orbit bridge as well as swapped on TON using the TonSwap DEX.

### Solidifying Orbs presence on TON

The recent addition of Orbs to the Orbit Bridge and the liquidity pool on TonSwap are 2 important milestones to solidify Orbs integration and expansion on the TON chain. 

In addition, this announcement follows the release of 2 major contributions by Orbs: [TON Minter](https://www.orbs.com/Announcing-TON-Minter-by-Orbs/) and [TON Verifier](https://www.orbs.com/Announcing-TON-Verifier-by-Orbs/). Minter has already assisted developers in deploying over 450+ Jettons and was added to the TON Foundation's official domain. While Verifier already covers a large portion (estimated 80%) of the contracts on the TON chain.
