**The Orbs project is excited to announce the launch of a new [ORBS-JPYC pool](https://info.quickswap.exchange/#/pair/0xd01c074c78e9647a5ddae2648f1a089b98d5380a) on QuickSwap, the leading DEX-AMM on Polygon!**

This new pool, together with Orbs PoS [multi-chain staking](https://www.orbs.com/polygon-staking/) on Polygon, provides a full and easy flow for Japanese Orbs Delegators to acquire and stake Orbs tokens in the Orbs Proof-of-Stake mechanism on the Polygon network.


### Streamlined Access to Orbs Liquidity 

Following feedback from the Japanese community regarding easier access to Orbs liquidity for Japanese token holders, a new ORBS liquidity pool has been opened on QuickSwap.

The pool currently has more than $80k in total liquidity and allows for direct swaps between JPYC and ORBS tokens. This in turn removes the need for “hopping” between different token pairs when swapping JPYC and ORBS, and as a result, reduces trading fees and price impact.

In addition to this new ORBS-JPYC pool, QuickSwap has additional pools for ORBS pairs, the largest of which is [ORBS-USDC](https://info.quickswap.exchange/#/pair/0xb2b6d423e535b57aad06e9866803b95fb66152ea) with almost $700k in liquidity.

QuickSwap is the largest DEX-AMM on the Polygon network with over $250M in TVL according to [Defi Llama](https://defillama.com/chain/Polygon).


### Orbs Multi-chain Staking on Polygon

Orbs recently launched its PoS V3: [Multichain staking](https://www.orbs.com/polygon-staking/) on Ethereum and Polygon. As a result, Orbs PoS staking is now available for Orbs Delegators on the Polygon network using [Tetra](https://www.orbs.com/How-to-Stake-ORBS-on-Polygon-Using-Tetra/), the official Orbs staking wallet.

Since launch, there has been increasing demand by Orbs Delegators to stake on Polygon, with almost 20% of the total delegated stake now found on Polygon. The new ORBS-JPYC pool is expected to boost inclusion and participation of Japanese Orbs token holders in the PoS staking, as well as solidify Orbs as a multi-chain protocol.


### JPYC - A leading Japanese Yen Stablecoin

[JPYC](https://jpyc.jp/) is an up-and-coming fully backed Japanese Yen stablecoin that enables easy access to the world of blockchain and DeFi for Japanese users.

Purchasing JPYC with Japanese Yen is an easy and user-friendly process. Here’s a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_4aGzKIod4&t=20s) on how to do it. Once purchased, the JPYC tokens can be received directly on Polygon, as well as other networks such as Ethereum, Avalanche and more.
