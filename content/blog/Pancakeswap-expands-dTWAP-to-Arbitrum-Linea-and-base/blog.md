**PancakeSwap, the largest DEX on BNB Chain, has expanded the dLimit and dTWAP protocols powered by Orbs to Arbitrum, Linea, and Base (in addition to existing BNB chain integration), alongside unveiling a sleek redesign.**

This integration brings advanced order types to PancakeSwap traders on these additional chains, enabling them to set specific price conditions for their trades or break large orders into smaller transactions to minimize slippage and market impact. These features enhance trading flexibility and efficiency while following successful integrations with other leading DEXs, including QuickSwap, SpookySwap, and Thena. Each implementation reinforces Orbs’ position as a leader in DeFi innovation, showcasing its novel Layer 3 technology that expands the possibilities of smart contracts.

Both products, developed by the Orbs team, are fully decentralized, permissionless, and composable protocols. With dLimit and dTWAP available on PancakeSwap, traders gain access to sophisticated tools like time-weighted average price orders, enabling seamless execution of algorithmic strategies. These advancements solidify PancakeSwap’s role as a premier platform delivering cutting-edge DeFi solutions across multiple ecosystems.

_[Orbs](https://www.orbs.com/) is a decentralized protocol executed by a public network of permissionless validators using PoS, staked with tens of millions of dollars in TVL. The protocol optimizes on-chain trading with L3 use cases that include aggregated liquidity, advanced trading orders, and decentralized derivatives, enabling a DeFi trading experience as efficient as CeFi._



### Trade DeFi like a Pro

In the past month, PancakeSwap facilitated a transaction volume of $53.9 billion, solidifying its position as a leader in DeFi. The integration of dLimit and dTWAP, previously available on BSC, has now expanded to PancakeSwap’s multichain ecosystem, marking their first deployment on Arbitrum, Linea, and Base. PancakeSwap is the top user of  Orbs’ technology in terms of volume.

For those unfamiliar, limit orders allow users to buy or sell tokens at a specific price. While the specified price is set as a condition, execution is not guaranteed and depends on market price movement. The order is only fulfilled if the market price aligns with the specified criteria.

In contrast, TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) orders are algorithmic strategies that break large trades into smaller transactions executed over a specific time frame. This reduces market impact and price slippage, making it particularly effective in DeFi, where liquidity pools require time to rebalance.

With these tools, PancakeSwap traders can access sophisticated trading strategies traditionally found in centralized finance, all while maintaining the benefits of decentralization.

### Setting up a dLIMIT and dTWAP orders

When switching to a dLIMIT ‘swap’ on PancakeSwap, users are presented with an easy-to-follow user interface alongside an order history tab to keep track of previous transactions. 

Before executing a dLIMIT order, traders must specify the following: 

1. **From:** The token that they currently have
2. **To:** The token that they wish to swap for
3. **Limit price:** Trades will ONLY be executed when the available market price is equal to or better than the Limit price.

dLIMIT takes into account current market conditions, prices, and gas fees. Once the parameters are set, the user can approve the specific source token, place the order, and review their order live in the ‘order history’ tab.

For a dTWAP order, three additional parameters need to be specified:

- **Total Trades:** the user can specify the number of individual trades. The UI automatically calculates the total number of transactions required to complete the entire order and the estimated trading interval.
- **Max Duration:** the maximum time during which the total amount of individual trades making up the entire dTWAP order may be executed.
- **Trade Interval:** This parameter sets the time gap between each trade. The user can edit this, changing the corresponding trade size and number parameters.

Similarly to dLIMIT, these parameters provide incredible flexibility in customizing each order, considering factors like market conditions and current gas fees. Additionally, the UI facilitates dTWAP-market orders, which execute all trades at the available market price, and dTWAP-Limit orders, which only execute individual trades if they are within the price Limit set by the user. Once these parameters are set, the user can approve the specific source token, place the order, and confirm their specified configuration.

### Redefining Trading Standards on Decentralized Exchanges

The dLIMIT & dTWAP protocol, powered by Orbs [L3 technology](https://www.orbs.com/overview/), has become the industry standard for decentralized algorithmic orders in DeFi. The ‘powered by Orbs branding’ has become a staple of confidence when executing advance orders on decentralized venues.

The protocol has been implemented by 14 prominent DEXs spanning 8 chains, facilitating over 15 million dollars of trading volume on a monthly basis.
