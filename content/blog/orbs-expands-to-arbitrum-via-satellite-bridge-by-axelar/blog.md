The beacons are aligned! Something is coming through! Satellite is warping ORBS onto Arbitrum, a major L2 with over [1.7B total value locked](https://defillama.com/chain/Arbitrum)!

Bridging from ETH to Arbitrum can be done using the following [link](https://satellite.money/?source=ethereum&destination=arbitrum&asset_denom=orbs-wei&destination_address=).

The official ORBS token contract address can be found here:

### About Arbitrum

Arbitrum is a layer 2 solution built to enhance the capabilities of Ethereum smart contracts. Its primary goals are to augment speed and scalability while also introducing additional privacy features. This platform is meticulously designed to offer developers the convenience of running unmodified Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) contracts and transactions on a secondary layer. This approach retains the robust security of Ethereum's primary layer.

The platform addresses prevalent issues in existing Ethereum-based smart contracts, including inefficiencies and high execution costs that have undermined user experiences and inflated transaction expenses.

Arbitrum employs an innovative approach called optimistic rollups. Transactions are executed off-chain, then grouped into substantial batches before being transmitted to the Ethereum mainnet as call data. By doing so, this process effectively alleviates the computational and storage burdens currently imposed on Ethereum's on-chain operations. Notably, each batch of transactions on Arbitrum incurs fixed costs on the Ethereum network, which are distributed across the involved transactions, contributing to a more predictable and manageable cost structure.

Orbs continues to be blockchain agnostic, building on any chain that adheres to core decentralized values. On Arbitrum specifically, Orbs recently integrated the dTWAP & dLIMIT with [Chronos](https://defillama.com/protocol/chronos). A leading decentralized exchange on the network. This also follows recent DeFi Notifications support for Arbitrum in the form of notifications [y2k finance](https://www.y2k.finance/), a popular DeFi Protocol.

### About Orbs

Orbs is a blockchain infrastructure project. Have been around since 2017, with the network and token live since 2019. Orbs is now focusing on building use cases supported by the network and tech.

The most used apps on Orbs now are dTWAP and dLIMIT - these are limit order and TWAP protocols that are 100% decentralized, EVM compatible, and can integrate with most DEXs. Currently live with multiple DEXs such as QuickSwap, SpookySwap, Thena, Chronos, and more.

The project is being developed by a dedicated team of more than 30 people, with team members in Tel Aviv, London, New York, Tokyo, and Seoul.
