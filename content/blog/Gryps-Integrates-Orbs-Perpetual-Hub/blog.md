Gryps has integrated Orbs’ Perpetual Hub Ultra to power institutional grade perpetual futures trading on SEI Network. Built exclusively for perpetuals, Gryps is a new generation derivatives protocol focused on execution, capital efficiency, and deterministic risk, not retail gamification or experimental liquidity models. From day one, Gryps has been designed as a professional infrastructure for traders who operate at scale.

With this integration, Gryps gains access to a fully managed, modular perpetuals stack designed for professional trading workflows. The upgrade enables deep, institutional grade liquidity sourcing, flexible and customizable leverage parameters, and highly efficient execution paths, all coordinated through Orbs’ intent-based infrastructure built on Symmio. The result is a perps trading experience optimized for capital efficiency, execution certainty, and predictable risk even under volatile market conditions.

Powered by Orbs’ Layer-3 infrastructure, this deployment builds on successful integrations of Perpetual Hub [legacy], cementing Orbs as the industry standard for turnkey perps infrastructure in DeFi. The Gryps dApp is currently in final preparation, with phased access rolling out soon.

[*Orbs*](https://www.orbs.com/) *is a decentralized infrastructure layer executed by a public network of permissionless validators using dPoS, staked with tens of millions of dollars in total value locked (TVL). Orbs Layer-3 infrastructure optimizes on-chain trading by providing aggregated liquidity, advanced trading orders, and decentralized derivatives, enabling a DeFi trading experience as efficient as CeFi.*


### About Perpetual Hub Ultra

Perpetual Hub Ultra is a fully integrated perpetual futures trading protocol developed by Orbs and Symm.io. It provides everything DEXs need to launch a high performance perps platform, including hedging, liquidation, oracles, and a professional-grade UI, all powered by Orbs’ Layer 3 decentralized infrastructure and Symm.io’s smart contract system.

Built for scalability and capital efficiency, once integrated, Ultra enables platforms to route liquidity from both on-chain and off-chain sources, including major centralized exchanges like Binance. This allows protocols to offer deep execution without needing to build a specialized chain or complex backend. By packaging the full perps stack into a modular integration layer, Ultra enables DEXs, frontends, and aggregators to deploy perps with minimal development effort and fast time to market.

As intent based trading continues to dominate DEX volume in spot markets, Perpetual Hub Ultra brings this same model to perps, enabling a new generation of trading venues to compete with centralized exchanges on performance, flexibility, and user experience while remaining fully decentralized.
