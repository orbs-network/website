How Orbs Hybrid Architecture Is Becoming a Game Changer in DeFi

![](/assets/img/blog/Nov-Update-Images2/avalanche.jpeg)

Since making the shift to DeFi, Orbs has seen a rapid expansion of its ecosystem.

Orbs is now live on all 5 major layer-1 (L1) chains: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Solana, with Avalanche being the latest addition. This in turn accelerated the integration of the Orbs ecosystem with over 17 major DeFi protocols.

Orbs' DeFi interoperability plays a critical role for the next stage of the project's roadmap, which is based on a new and innovative concept and analysis of the current needs of the entire DeFi community.

Existing L1 and L2 infrastructure chains are, generally, all implemented as EVM smart contracts. These smart contracts are powerful in securing and processing TVL, but are very limited in their capabilities.

[Orbs adds another layer](https://www.orbs.com/How-Orbs-Hybrid-Architecture-Is-Becoming-a-Game-Changer-in-DeFi/) on top of L1 and L2 (let's call it L3 for now) that can work in conjunction with other L1+L2 layers to enrich the capabilities of EVM-based smart contracts. Such a layer opens the door for many exciting and innovative applications in the DeFi space which are currently not available.

1.  The first infrastructure layer, L1 - like Ethereum - is in charge of security.

2.  The second infrastructure layer, L2 - such as Polygon - is in charge of scalability.

3.  The third infrastructure layer, L3 - is in charge of helping apps build and extract more value. This layer provides services to existing DeFi applications to enhance their capabilities. Orbs is in a strong position to be a major contributor here.¬†

Orbs Goes Live on Raydium

After bridging the ORBS token into Solana, the next step is to integrate it with Solana's DeFi ecosystem.

Raydium: The Next Evolution of DeFi

Raydium is an automated market maker (AMM) built on the Solana blockchain which enables lightning-fast trades, shared liquidity and new features for earning yield.

Raydium has a Total Value Locked of over $2B, with daily trading volume exceeding $250M.

There is currently one Orbs pool on Raydium for ORBS-SOL, with a total liquidity of ~$57K.

Avalanche integrations & further expansion: Orbs farming & single stake goes live on¬†

Pangolin

![](/assets/img/blog/Nov-Update-Images2/poster2.jpg)

Pangolin users can now farm PNG tokens on the ORBS-AVAX pool and earn ORBS tokens in Pangolin's¬†

Single-stake feature!

After recently adding the Orbs tokens to their platform, Pangolin is now launching farming and Single-stake for ORBS.

Users can now farm Pangolin's native token, PNG, by providing liquidity to the ORBS-AVAX pool which can then¬†

be staked to earn ORBS tokens.

The launch of ORBS farming and staking by Pangolin, one of the leading DEX-AMMs on the Avalanche network,¬†

is another important step to solidify the Orbs community's presence on Avalanche. This follows other¬†

successful protocol integrations on the Avalanche network such as AvaScan and Trader Joe.

In addition, Pangolin has recently announced their V2 farms and chose the ORBS-AVAX pool to be included in¬†

their [V2 launch](https://twitter.com/pangolindex/status/1462632722858496005).
