**We’re excited to announce that Orbs is now live on the official Polygon bridge!**

In this recent post, we provided some background on Polygon and discussed why many popular applications, such as [Aave](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-major-aave-working-with-polygon-to-bypass-ethereum-congestion), [SushiSwap](https://blog.polygon.technology/continuing-defi-summer-sushiswap-is-live-on-polygon-with-30m-usd-in-liquidity-rewards-b58c6dcc98a6) and [CREAM Finance](https://www.coindesk.com/cream-finance-announces-integration-with-polygon), have opted to build directly on the more efficient Polygon protocol in terms of transaction costs and speeds. We also showcased how this rapid migration of applications to the Polygon led to a massive increase of on-chain activity on the Polygon network.

As a result, we believe it is important for the Orbs project and its community to collaborate with this ecosystem, making Polygon an optimal candidate for the next phase of the Orbs ecosystem expansion.

### Bridging the Polygon Gap

As with any new ecosystem, the first step is to bridge the Token to the new network.

To achieve this, theOrbs token has been integrated to the official Ethereum – Polygon cross-chain bridge developed by the Polygon project.

Consequently, ORBS token holders can now easily migrate their ERC20 tokens to the Polygon network using the following link:

Simply connect your wallet to the Polygon bridge, search for the Orbs token in the search bar and approve the transfer, as shown below:

You can find the bridged ORBS token contract on Polygon here:

As always, exercise caution when working with 3rd party technologies, educate yourself regarding the risks involved, and read all security audits.

### Untapping the Polygon Potential

It’s becoming more and more clear that DeFi is taking a central role in the crypto space, spanning multiple chains and ecosystems. New and exciting projects keep innovating and introducing new technological advancements and protocols.

Polygon is emerging as the leading 2nd layer solution on Ethereum, positioning itself as a potential market leader. As such, Orbs is excited to start its journey on the Polygon network, exploring the possibilities it presents.
