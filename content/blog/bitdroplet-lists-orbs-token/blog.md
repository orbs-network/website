### ORBS, the native token of the Orbs Network, has been listed on Bitdroplet dApp by Bitbns!

[Bitdroplet](https://bitdroplet.com/dapp/) is a decentralized systematic investment plan (SIP) for investing in various crypto assets. With over 4.7 million active users, Bitdroplet enables deploying SIP strategies without relying on centralized exchanges.

The team behind Bitdrop is the team that created Bitbns, India's largest cryptocurrency exchange, where Orbs is already[ listed](https://www.orbs.com/bitbns-exchange-lists-orbs-token-orbs/). The founders of Bitbns, which was founded in 2017, continued their passion for making crypto investments accessible to all and created Bitdrop dApp.

### How it works:

1.  Start a SIP by selecting crypto pair, frequency & SIP amount

2.  Connect your any Dapp wallet, then confirm your SIP 

3.  SIP will now continue till funds last. Then, add funds for SIP to continue

Orbs' listing on Bitdroplet dApp follows a series of other exchange listings for the ORBS token on both centralized and decentralized exchanges. CEXs include among others Huobi, KuCoin, Gate.io, Latoken, Coinsbit, and more. In addition, Orbs is also available on leading DEXs across 7 leading DeFi chains including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, Harmony, and TON. Leading DEXs include, among others, Uniswap, Sushi, Quickswap, Spookyswap, TraderJoe, and more.

### About Bitdroplet 

Due to its high volatility, cryptocurrency's utility has largely been limited to asset trading. In order to resolve this problem, Bitdroplet introduced "Bitdroplet SPP" (Systematic Purchase Plan) in 2019, and invented a new kind of utility for crypto (through long-term investments). SPP is similar to a conventional Systematic Investment Plan (SIP), except that SPP has been crafted for investing in crypto assets.

While working to expand it, Bitdroplet got a lot of recommendations to start a decentralized SPP platform for crypto users around the globe so they could stack their own cryptocurrencies. Today, Bitdroplet is developing its leading decentralized SPP platform for all kinds of BEP20 tokens including BTCB.
