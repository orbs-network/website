In a [recent](https://www.orbs.com/how-to-bridge-orbs-tokens-onto-the-polygon-network/) blog post we announced that the ORBS token is now available on Polygon (previously known as Matic Network), using the official Polygon cross-chain [bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/) between Ethereum and Polygon.

Even though not much time has passed, looking at the ORBS [token contract](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x614389eaae0a6821dc49062d56bda3d9d45fa2ff) on Polygon we can already see that almost 1M ORBS tokens have crossed from Ethereum to Polygon!

After bridging the ORBS token into Polygon, the next step is to integrate it with the Polygon DeFi ecosystem - one of the [fastest growing](https://www.orbs.com/orbs-ecosystem-expansion-whats-next/) DeFi ecosystems out there.

Well...

### QuickSwap: Next-gen Layer 2 DEX

QuickSwap is the leading DEX-AMM on the Polygon network, utilizing the layer 2 properties of Polygon to offer lightning-fast speed with near-zero gas fees, making it a very attractive platform for DeFi users. To date, QuickSwap has over $1B in Total Value Locked (TVL) and over $100M in daily volume.

Looking at the [Orbs token page](https://info.quickswap.exchange/token/0x614389eaae0a6821dc49062d56bda3d9d45fa2ff), we can see that there are already 2 active ORBS pools on QuickSwap!

- USDC-ORBS, with liquidity of ~$75k

- ORBS-QUICK, with liquidity of ~$65k

Swapping ORBS and adding liquidity to the ORBS pool can be easily done through the Orbs token page by clicking on the relevant button on the top right-hand corner of the screen.

**Note**: If this is your first time swapping ORBS on QuickSwap, you may need to import the ORBS token into your token list by confirming the correct token address:

[0x614389eaae0a6821dc49062d56bda3d9d45fa2ff](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x614389eaae0a6821dc49062d56bda3d9d45fa2ff)

### Orbs Is Live On All 3 Major Chains!

With this recent integration into the Polygon network, Orbs is now live on all three major chains: Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon!

Ethereum, being the native chain of the ORBS token, was the first to pave the way, with integrations into all the major DeFi platforms such as UniSwap, SushiSwap, Balancer, 1inch, and more. The best way to to keep track of the Orbs DeFi progress on Ethereum is via the [Orbs DeFi Portal](https://orbsdefi.com/), a project by one of the Orbs project's prominent contributors: Paradigm Fund. The portal aggregates everything you need to know about Orbs and DeFi on Ethereum in one place - real-time market data for Orbs liquidity pools, education materials and how-to manuals for swapping and adding liquidity, research papers, and more...

Next came **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**. Orbs' integration on BSC got off to a flying start with the launching of the Orbs syrup pool on PancakeSwap. This was a major driver to a whole set of new integrations, including: Beefy vaults, Alpaca Finance, WOWswap, and more. All of this led to a significant on-chain growth for Orbs on BSC, with a rapid growth across all metrics such as the amount of ORBS tokens on BSC, the number of addresses holding Orbs, the number of total Orbs transfers and transfer amounts, and more...

**Polygon** is the third and latest integration, with Quickswap serving as the first platform. Polygon is emerging as the leading 2nd layer solution on Ethereum, positioning itself as a potential market leader. As such, Orbs is excited to start its journey on the Polygon network, exploring the possibilities it presents. Expect more news soon!
