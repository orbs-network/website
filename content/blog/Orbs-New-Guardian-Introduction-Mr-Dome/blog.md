Alongside the previous two governance votes, [OGV-1](https://snapshot.org/#/orbs-network.eth/proposal/0x770671f96d4eca72867acc6b4ce645cbd76e17e47a69f6da28ad9783b1aae930) & [OGV-2](https://snapshot.org/#/orbs-network.eth/proposal/0xc2f4c60c94b6955dfd6ccfbfdbd40dc8f516352e015dce0f5deac9186154095f) that had over 60% of the total staked $ORBS participating, the Orbs community is welcoming another Guardian, Mr. Dome, who joins the ecosystem as a Guardian during a phase of high engagement from the community. 

We’re excited to introduce Mr. Dome to the Orbs community, and we asked him a few questions to better understand his position as a Guardian and what drew his attention to the project.  

**Q1: Please introduce yourself and tell us what made you interested in Orbs?**

Hello, everyone. I am the small Guardian "Mr.Dome" :)

After entering this industry in 2021 without any knowledge, I felt I needed to do something more during this bear market in May 2022. So one of the things I studied was whitepapers of some crypto projects, and I found Orbs is a sustainable project.

**Q2: What do you think of Orbs' L3 business strategy?**

I think L3 can be unique and a new way to go through difficult market conditions. It sets Orbs apart from other projects and introduces some innovative use cases.

**Q3：How do you plan to boost up your community as a Guardian?**

I will grow my blog and Twitter. Even though I'm not a professional at this, I do have some ideas  and I'll do my best to develop a community alongside Orbs.

**Q4：Any messages to the Orbs community? Where can we find more information about you?**

Unlike other Guardians, I am quite small. But I became a Guardian to contribute to Orbs as a member of the ecosystem. Anyone can be a Guardian or a Delegator. The door is always open for you, and it's not too hard to become one. :)

I hope to better Orbs with my efforts. 

Orbs Delegators can find out more information on my website and can reach me on Twitter:

PoS V3 is the Orbs network Proof of Stake mechanism, powering the network by utilizing [multi-chain staking](https://www.orbs.com/polygon-staking/) on Ethereum and Polygon. 

Orbs Guardians represent the Orbs community, they maintain the security of the network and uphold its long term vision, investing time and effort in the network's success. Mr. Dome joins another new Guardian, “Mind Heart Soul”, making it 2 new Guardians that have joined the Orbs PoS ecosystem in recent weeks! 

The display of strength by the Orbs community, also demonstrated in the recent Governance votes, as well as the participation of new stakeholders in the Orbs ecosystem is an important indicator of the Orbs project community’s vitality and endurance.
