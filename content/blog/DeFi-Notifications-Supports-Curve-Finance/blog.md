**The Open DeFi Notifications Protocol has integrated with Curve Finance, one of the largest DeFi protocols with over $2.4B in TVL!**

[Curve Finance](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/swap) is one of the largest and well known DeFi protocols, ranked at [#7 by DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/), with over $2.4B in TVL. Curve is one of DeFi’s leading DEX-AMM which employs proprietary formulas to provide high liquidity, low slippage, and low fee transactions among ERC-20 tokens.

Curve users can now use the Open DeFi Notifications Protocol to set up a **‘Staking Unlocked’** notification to be notified once their CRV tokens locking period has expired.

The [Open DeFi Notification Protocol](https://defi.org/notifications/) App is available on the [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp).

_The Open DeFi Notification Protocol by defi.org is a community led initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events._


### Don’t Miss an Unlocking Event

Curve users have the option to [vote lock](https://resources.curve.fi/crv-token/understanding-crv) their CRV tokens to acquire veCRV, which has three main uses: voting, staking and boosting. These tokens are locked for a period ranging from 1 week to 4 years. Once this time period is over, the tokens need to be re-locked in order to generate additional fees.

CRV’s long locking periods can make it hard for users to track their unlocking events, especially for multiple locked token batches, thereby leaving their tokens sitting idle without generating fees.

Well, not anymore!

**Using the Open DeFi Notification Protocol, Curve users can set up a “Staking Unlocked” notification to alert them on their veCRV unlocking events.**

### A Notification Standard for Leading DeFi Projects

The Open DeFi Notification Protocol is an open initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events. 

The addition of Curve makes for an impressive lineup of leading DeFi projects which have already been integrated into the Open DeFi Notification app for the benefit of their users, including, among others: Aave, Uniswap, SushiSwap, QuickSwap, PancakeSwap, and more…

**The app supports over 30 protocols across 7 networks: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Fantom, Cronos, Avalanche, and Arbitrum!**

The Protocol has been implemented fully by the [Orbs network](https://www.orbs.com/) and will be executed by the Orbs Guardians, making this the 1st fully decentralized implementation of a notification protocol.
