### About Orbs PoS Universe

Since Orbs launched in 2019, The[ Orbs Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Universe](https://www.orbs.com/pos/) has been the backbone of the Orbs network and the Universe created. Generally, users can participate in the ecosystem by staking ORBS tokens in smart contracts using [TETRA](https://status.orbs.network/), the web-based official Orbs staking wallet dApp.

TETRA is the official ORBS staking dApp, providing connectivity to the entire POS network.  To stake Orbs, it is recommended that users should use a PC's web browser or alternatively, if using mobile, the embedded dApp browser. 

### TETRA Mobile

Now for further accessibility, we are excited to introduce "TETRA Mobile" an official IOS & Android app for the Orbs POS network. The first wallet connected with this app is [KLIP wallet](https://klipwallet.com/). KLIP is a custodial wallet operated by GroundX(Kakao group). Integrating a custodial wallet may be a viable options for users who elect not to create a decentralized wallet fully controlled by their own backup, which requires sophisticated security measures.

You can download the app from the links below:

### Supports other wallets

Orbs PoS Universe supports various crypto-wallets both on desktop and mobile.The majority of delegators use Metamask to interact with TETRA, this can be done via desktop as per usual. This has not changed with the launch of TETRA Mobile. If you are using other non-custodial mobile wallets such as Metamask, Coinbase wallet, or other mobile wallets, you can still stake with [Tetra web version](https://status.orbs.network/) through an embedded dApp browser in their respective application. Also, we support Samsung blockchain wallet which is an embedded hardware wallet in Galaxy smartphones via the [ORBS PoS Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.pos) application. With this app, you can connect a Ledger hardware wallet too.
