Orbs and PancakeSwap announce the launch of the Orbs Syrup Pool!

The Orbs Syrup pool on PancakeSwap enables users to farm Orbs tokens on the ORBS-BUSD pool by staking CAKE tokens.

We are very excited about this special promotion campaign with PancakeSwap as it is expected to strengthen the ties of Orbs in the BSC DeFi ecosystem, as well as increase exposure for the Orbs project to the BSC user-base.

The Orbs Syrup pool campaign will last 60 days with a total of 6.73M ORBS tokens available for farming.

### Campaign Goals and Objectives

The Orbs â€“ PancakeSwap Syrup campaign has 4 important objectives:

- **Reach a new user base:** The BSC is a fast-growing DeFi ecosystem with its own set of tools, applications, and users. Having Orbs on BSC will open up the Orbs project to an additional crowd of DeFi participants that are not necessarily found on Ethereum.
- **Incentivize Orbs migration to BSC:** Orbs has been recently integrated into BSC. The Syrup promotion campaign will help migrate more Orbs tokens into BSC to take part in its growing ecosystem.
- **Provide liquidity to Orbs pools:** Syrup incentivizes liquidity providers to add liquidity into the ORBS-BUSD pool, thereby reducing swap slippage.
- **Assert conviction in the BSC ecosystem:** We believe that BSC has great potential and opportunity in the DeFi space, as proven by its meteoric growth. Orbs is excited to take part in it.

### How to Participate?

In order to participate in the Orbs Syrup pool, you will need to have BSC-compatible, BEP20, Orbs tokens.

For most, this means migrating your Orbs tokens from the Ethereum network into BSC.

Luckily, this can be done easily using [multichain.xyz](https://multichain.xyz/) cross-chain bridge infrastructure in the following link:

### Explore more about Orbs and BSC

In the last couple of months, Orbs has made a significant move into the DeFi space. This includes integration to most of the popular DeFi applications on the Ethereum Network, such as [Uniswap](https://blog.orbsdefi.com/p/orbs-on-uniswap-and-whats-next), [SushiSwap](/orbs-is-now-live-on-sushiswap), [1inch](/orbs-is-now-live-on-1inch-exchange), and many more. In addition, Orbs recently revealed its flagship project: [Liquidity Nexus](https://nexus.orbs.com/), which aims to bring CeFi into the DeFi space.

With the rapid growth of DeFi, BSC has been quick to take action, quickly becoming one of the major players in the space. Here are some of the current projects Orbs is working on with regards to the Binance DeFi ecosystem. More updates to be released soon!

#### DeFi.org accelerator

On January 11, Orbs and Binance [announced](https://www.binance.org/en/blog/orbs-and-binance-team-up-to-launch-defi-accelerator/) that they are teaming up to promote innovation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space by serving as the first core sponsors of the [DeFi.org](https://defi.org/) accelerator, which bootstraps new projects and DeFi protocols.

### Orbs Live on PancakeSwap

[PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/) is the most popular DEX/AMM on BSC. It is very similar to Uniswap and SushiSwap and was actually one of the first forks of Uniswap that was deployed to BSC. PancakeSwap is also the number one protocol on BSC in terms of TVL according to DefiStation, with a Total Value Locked (TVL) of just under $10B (!!).

Having Orbs listed on PancakeSwap is an important first milestone to gain a foothold for Orbs on Binance Smart Chain.
