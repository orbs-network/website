We've recently announced an additional vertical for the Orbs network as a L3, operating in conjunction with L1 + L2 layers to enrich the capabilities of EVM-based smart contracts. To realize this goal, Orbs needs to become a multi-chain asset. Therefore, Orbs further steps are to continue accelerating the integration of the project's ecosystem with major DeFi chains and platforms.

Thus, Orbs has targeted [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/) as its next chain integration, and is pleased to announce that it is going live on [Horizon bridge](https://bridge.harmony.one/busd), the official cross-chain bridge by Harmony.

How to Bridge Orbs on Horizon

Harmony has recently launched [Horizon](https://bridge.harmony.one/busd), a trustless, gas-efficient cross-chain bridge for transferring any ERC20 asset between Ethereum, BSC and Harmony. The Horizon bridge currently has more than $260M in total value locked.

In order to bridge Orbs onto Harmony, simply pick the ORBS token from the pulldown list in the [Horizon Bridge page](https://bridge.harmony.one/erc20). Orbs holders can select between Ethereum and BSC chains.

Unlocking The Horizon Potential

Harmony is considered a promising project with many excellent ideas and tech solutions, becoming a key protocol in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. Thus, it is exciting for Orbs to start its journey on Harmony's Horizon, exploring the possibilities and opportunities it presents. Bridging Orbs onto Harmony is the first step for unlocking this potential.
