In the ever-evolving landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi), strategic partnerships play a pivotal role in driving innovation and growth. 

Orbs is proud to announce a significant milestone in its ongoing collaboration with [Thena](https://www.thena.fi/), a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on the BNB Chain. This partnership not only signifies a strong belief in Thena's vision and capabilities but also reflects a shared commitment to shaping the future of decentralized finance with Orbs [layer 3](https://www.orbs.com/overview/) technology.

As part of this partnership, Orbs will be making a strategic financial investment in the Thena project, highlighting confidence in the project's potential. This financial backing positions Thena to accelerate its growth and development, and to leverage Orbs' support for innovative initiatives within the decentralized exchange landscape. This investment reflects a shared commitment to advancing the decentralized finance sector and represents a powerful alliance between two forward-thinking projects.

### A History of Collaboration

The collaboration between Orbs and Thena dates back to June of this year when Thena integrated Orbs' [dLIMIT](https://www.orbs.com/dlimit/) and [dTWAP](https://www.orbs.com/dtwap/) protocols. This integration marked a crucial step in enhancing Thena's trading capabilities, providing users with access to advanced order types and algorithmic trading strategies.

### Strategic Partnership

Orbs is entering into a strategic partnership with Thena, demonstrating a deep belief in the team's potential and the shared commitment to building a decentralized future. This collaboration goes beyond financial support; it highlights Orbs’ alignment with Thena's vision and Thena’s endorsement of the potential of Orbs’ L3 technology. This partnership signifies the beginning of an exciting new chapter for both projects. 

### Liquidity Hub Unleashed

Orbs recently launched its flagship project: [Liquidity Hub](https://www.orbs.com/Liquidity-Hub-by-Orbs-The-New-Standard-for-DEXs/), with Quickswap DEX.

**As part of this strategic partnership, Thena will be the second DEX to integrate Liquidity Hub powered by Orbs layer 3 technology.**

Liquidity Hub by Orbs is set to revolutionize Thena's DEX-AMM by bringing the power of aggregated liquidity. This infrastructure software optimizes the trading process by tapping into external liquidity sources, providing better price quotes and reducing price impact for users.
