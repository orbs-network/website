Hello Orbs community!

Wow wow wow! What a crazy month this has been!

This might be the busiest month ever for the Orbs project. So much has happened, it's hard to keep track of. For example, during this month, there were no less than 8 exchange listings (!!), including tier-1 exchanges such as FTX and KuCoin.

Due to the sheer amount of content and announcements this month, we decided to change the format a bit -

Below you’ll find a table of contents for this month’s update. Each title will take you to the relevant section to read more about the subject so that you can easily navigate through the content.

Enjoy!

### Single-sided farming

The Orbs [Liquidity Nexus protocol](https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service/) is the first to introduce the concept of Single-sided farming.

Take any DEX, whether it’s SushiSwap or PancakeSwap, and choose a popular pool like ETH/USDC or BNB/BUSD.

The CeFi capital provides the stable side — USDC or BUSD. The DeFi capital provides the crypto side — ETH or BNB. Now, let them farm together.

Single-sided farming is explained in this 3-part blog post series:
