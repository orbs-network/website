Orbs is thrilled to announce that it has been chosen to participate as a launch partner in a collaboration between Apeswap and Quickswap Dragons, in which they will introduce a groundbreaking DeFi product: QuickSwap Bonds, powered by ApeBond.


### An Exciting Opportunity

Orbs is excited to serve as a launch partner in this initiative by leading DeFi projects, including Quickswap, Apeswap, DappRadar, and more. 

The inclusion of Orbs Bonds as part of this initiative on Quickswap marks a unique opportunity for users to actively engage with the Orbs project while simultaneously fortifying the Orbs liquidity pool on the Quickswap decentralized exchange (DEX).

The Orbs community is already familiar with the Quickswap project, with Quickswap being the first DEX to integrate and launch the latest L3 product powered by Orbs, [Liquidity Hub](https://www.orbs.com/Liquidity-Hub-by-Orbs-The-New-Standard-for-DEXs/). This innovative protocol, powered by Orbs layer 3 technology, functions as a decentralized optimization layer above Automated Market Makers (AMMs), effectively addressing the issue of fragmented liquidity in DeFi.



### How Does it Work?

Inspired by a combination of TradFi, DeFi, and NFT products, ApeSwap Bonds is an initiative to ensure the long-term health of protocols while offering new ways to generate sustainable liquidity.

If you’re not familiar with Bonds yet, here’s an easy explanation: Users can purchase Orbs Bonds on Quickswap at a discount. In order to do this, users who have provided liquidity to an Orbs pool on Quickswap can exchange their LP tokens in exchange for an NFT issued by Apeswap that represents the bond. This NFT contains the Bond details, which will vest linearly over a set period of time (vesting term).

For a more in-depth rundown of Bonds, visit the [ApeBonds docs](https://apeswap.gitbook.io/apeswap-finance/product-and-features/apeswap-bonds).
