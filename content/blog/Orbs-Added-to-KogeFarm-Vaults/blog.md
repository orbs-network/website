[KogeFarm](https://kogefarm.io/vaults) is a yield optimizer platform on the Polygon network that utilizes the unique L2 features of Polygon to boost farming rewards. Due to Polygon’s very low transaction fees, KogeFarm [auto-compounds](https://koge.gitbook.io/kogefarm/why-autocompound) farming rewards every 5 minutes to achieve maximum efficiency.

**As always, exercise caution when working with 3rd party technologies and [educate](https://koge.gitbook.io/kogefarm/audit) yourself regarding the risks involved.**


### A Strong Start for Orbs on Polygon

Orbs recently [announced](https://www.orbs.com/how-to-bridge-orbs-tokens-onto-the-polygon-network/) that it has bridged the ORBS token to the Polygon network. Soon after that, several Orbs pools were [created](https://www.orbs.com/orbs-is-now-live-on-quickswap/) on QuickSwap, the leading DEX-AMM on Polygon.

This strong foundation for Orbs on Polygon was the key driver to [launch](https://www.orbs.com/Orbs-Extinction-Pool-Launched-on-DinoSwap/) the Orbs Extinction Pool on DinoSwap, which now boasts over $1.7M in liquidity.

The successful onboarding of Orbs into the Polygon Ecosystem continues with yet another integration with a leading project: KogeFarm. This is an important step to further solidify Orbs presence on Polygon as well as attract a larger user-base to get familiar with the Orbs project.


### Side Note: What is the Difference Between APY and APR?

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate, while APY is Annual Percentage Yield. The difference is that APR does not include compounding effects. For example, If you were to invest $100 with 100% APR, you would make $100 in profit.
If, however, you reinvest your profits regularly, you will compound your interest. This compounding, calculated over a year gives you the APY. The more often you compound your interest, the greater the difference between APR and APY.

**As can be seen above, this difference can be quite significant, making Vaults very attractive products for DeFi users.**
