The decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape is evolving rapidly, and Orbs is leading this transformation. A significant milestone has been achieved with the integration of Orbs’ [Perpetual Hub](https://www.orbs.com/perpetual-hub/) and IVX on Berachain, enhancing decentralized derivatives trading. This collaboration aims to improve liquidity, efficiency, and accessibility in perpetual trading, reinforcing Orbs’ commitment to building robust decentralized infrastructure.

The integration of Orbs’ Perpetual Hub with IVX on Berachain introduces a suite of advanced features designed to enhance the decentralized derivatives trading experience. By leveraging Orbs’ Layer-3 technology, IVX can now offer optimized order execution, improved capital efficiency, and robust risk management. This collaboration not only streamlines the trading process but also ensures a secure and trustless environment for users, eliminating the need for centralized intermediaries. As a result, traders on IVX can expect a more seamless and efficient platform, further solidifying Orbs’ commitment to advancing decentralized finance infrastructure.

The protocol optimizes on-chain trading with L3 use cases that include aggregated liquidity, advanced trading orders, and decentralized derivatives, enabling a DeFi trading experience as efficient as CeFi._


### About IVX

IVX is a hub of derivatives built on Berachain. It offers users leverage-based instruments in the form of an order book perpetual futures market and 0dte options, enabling them to trade assets with high leverage!

**Key Features of IVX**

- **Diem AMM:** Allows the trading of 0dte options across assets such as BTC, ETH, and BERA offering users at times even 500x leverage through option gated instruments.
- **Portfolio Margin Accounts:** Users can create self-custodial, smart contract-based portfolio accounts to trade options on margin without liquidating their existing assets. This setup supports complex option strategies with cross-margining benefits.
-  **Levo Orderbook:** This orderbook futures market provides a wide range of crypto assets to trade with leverage. It uses a solver network to facilitate deep liquidity from the top exchanges in the space today.


IVX leverages Berachain’s Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) consensus mechanism, enhancing network security and efficiency.  The platform also integrates gasless transactions through Gelato, streamlining the user experience by eliminating the need for gas fees during trading. 

To familiarize users with its features, IVX launched the Artio and Bartio testnet, offering an incentive program for participants to explore 0DTE options trading before the mainnet release anticipated to launch this month.
