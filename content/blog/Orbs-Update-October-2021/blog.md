<div class='line-separator'> </div>


### Introducing Open DeFi Notification Protocol

![notification](/assets/img/blog/Orbs-Update-October-2021/image1.jpg)

The Orbs team has been super focused on untapping the potential of Orbs in the DeFi space. With its unique hybrid architecture, the Orbs project is designed for interoperability with EVM compatible blockchains such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and, Avalanche, which are the leading venues in terms of asset liquidity and user engagement.


One of the most promising projects Orbs is currently working on, in collaboration with DeFi.org, is the **Open DeFi Notification Protocol** - an open initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events. We believe this is a critical piece of the DeFi infrastructure puzzle and it could make a real impact for DeFi users.

Orbs is proud to be a primary design partner to help implement the protocol. Our team is contributing many of the integrations to the most popular DeFi projects out there (like Sushi and Aave) and helped design a decentralized architecture of how it can be implemented. 
The Orbs  network of decentralized Guardians is set to make its own contribution by running the protocol as an app over the Orbs Network and utilizing Orbs Network‚Äôs unique consensus as a service architecture to provide for decentralized infrastructure execution!

Read all about it in the official [announcement](https://www.orbs.com/Introducing-Open-DeFi-Notification-Protocol/).

### Orbs on Avalanche

![avalanche](/assets/img/blog/Orbs-Update-October-2021/image3.jpg)


In recent posts we announced that the ORBS token is now available on Avalanche using the AnySwap cross-chain bridge between Ethereum, BSC and Avalanche. Soon after, the Orbs token address was whitelisted on AvaScan, the leading Avalanche block explorer.

Following these successful integrations, Orbs is now officially part of the Avalanche ecosystem. As a result, the ORBS token can now be tracked on the Avalanche blockchain using the [AvaScan explorer](https://www.orbs.com/ORBS-is-now-live-on-AvaScan/)! 

More so, Avalanche users can swap and add liquidity to Orbs pools on [Trader Joe](https://www.orbs.com/ORBS-is-now-live-on-Trader-Joe/), the leading DEX-AMM on the Avalanche network and [Pangolin](https://www.orbs.com/ORBS-is-Now-Available-on-Pangolin/), a new community-driven decentralized exchange for Avalanche and Ethereum assets.
