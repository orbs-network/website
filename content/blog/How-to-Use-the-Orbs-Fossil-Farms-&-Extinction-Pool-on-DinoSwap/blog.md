The Orbs project [recently](https://www.orbs.com/orbs-ecosystem-expansion-whats-next/) announced that it has expanded its ecosystem into the Polygon Network. ORBS was integrated into the official Polygon [bridge](https://www.orbs.com/how-to-bridge-orbs-tokens-onto-the-polygon-network/) and Orbs [pools](https://www.orbs.com/orbs-is-now-live-on-quickswap/) were opened on QuickSwap.

**Soon after, DinoSwap [announced](https://www.orbs.com/Orbs-Extinction-Pool-Launched-on-DinoSwap/) that they are launching the Orbs Fossil Farm and Extinction Pool!**

DinoSwap is an advanced DeFi protocol that interfaces directly with the ORBS-USDC pool on QuickSwap. We are very excited about this special integration with DinoSwap as it is expected to strengthen the ties of Orbs to the Polygon DeFi ecosystem, increase ORBS liquidity, and also increase exposure of the Orbs project to the Polygon user-base.

In this blog post you will find a short tutorial of how to use the Orbs pools on DinoSwap.

### Step-by-Step Guide

The Orbs Fossil Farm interfaces directly with the QuickSwap DEX-AMM on Polygon. Orbs users will need 2 basic things in order to be able to interact with the Polygon network:

1. Set up MetaMask wallet for Polygon. This is a very simple and easy process as explained in this short [guide](https://medium.com/stakingbits/setting-up-metamask-for-polygon-matic-network-838058f6d844).

2. On the Polygon network, MATIC is the currency used for conducting transactions. Each transaction costs a very small fee to process, and that fee is paid in the form of gas with a MATIC token. If you do not have any MATIC in your wallet, then you can not send any transactions! You can get initial MATIC to get you started on Polygon for free [here](https://macncheese.finance/matic-polygon-mainnet-faucet.php). After that, you can always swap more MATIC tokens on any DEX for ongoing transaction fees

**Now you are all set to start!**

Here is a short tutorial and a summarized process flow for using the OrbsFossil Farms & Extinction Pool on DinoSwap:

And here is the basic flow you'll need to do:

**1) Bridge Orbs tokens onto Polygon**

The first step is to bridge your Orbs tokens from Ethereum to Polygon, if you haven't already done so. Read this [blog post](https://www.orbs.com/how-to-bridge-orbs-tokens-onto-the-polygon-network/) to learn how it's done using the official Polygon [bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/).

**2) Add liquidity on QuickSwap**

Next, you’ll need to [add liquidity](https://quickswap.exchange/#/add/0x614389eaae0a6821dc49062d56bda3d9d45fa2ff/ETH) to the ORBS-USDC pool on QuickSwap. After adding liquidity, you will receive **ORBS-USDC LP tokens** which you’ll need to use in the next step. Here is a short [guide](https://www.orbs.com/orbs-is-now-live-on-quickswap/) for using Orbs on QuickSwap.

To add liquidity, you will need ORBS and USDC in equal parts in terms of USD value. To achieve this you can bridge USDC to Polygon, or simply swap some of your ORBS for USDC.

**3) Stake in DinoSwap’s Fossil Farms**

The next step is to stake your **ORBS-USDC LP** tokens in the Orbs [Fossil Farm](https://dinoswap.exchange/farms?t=l) on DinoSwap. Once the LP tokens are staked you will start to earn DINO tokens. Claiming these DINO tokens is done by pressing the “Excavate” button.

**4) Excavate Orbs in the Extinction Pools**

The final step is to stake your DINO tokens in the Orbs [Extinction Pool](https://dinoswap.exchange/pools?t=l) and earn ORBS tokens rewards. Note that by entering these pools, you should understand that **100% of your deposited DINO will be burned** to earn the reward tokens over the remaining duration of the pool.
