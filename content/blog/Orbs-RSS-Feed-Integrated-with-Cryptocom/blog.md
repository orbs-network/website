Through the [Orbs (ORBS) Price Page](https://crypto.com/price/orbs), you can now directly access Orbs’s RSS feed and acquire the latest news and updates on Orbs. On the price page, you can also obtain all of the information you require on the Orbs project, including price tracking and statistics, Orbs trading market data, Orbs ERC20 smart contract information, links to additional content and social media, etc. 

In addition, the Crypto.com price page enables users to add the ORBS token price tracker to their watchlist as well as set up price and price movement alerts.

### Orbs Price Widget by Crypto.com

In addition to being added to the Crypto.com price page, the Orbs team has integrated a live price widget on the Orbs [PoS Analytics](https://analytics.orbs.network/ethereum/overview/stake) webpage. The Widget also links to the Orbs price page on Crypto.com, which allows Orbs token holders easy access to the Orbs token information provided by Crypto.com.

The addition of Orbs to the ecosystem of a major crypto project like Crypto.com is an important step to establish the credibility of the ORBS token as well as raise awareness about the project with a huge number of crypto users. We hope that this will pave the way for additional integrations and collaborations with Cypto.com.
