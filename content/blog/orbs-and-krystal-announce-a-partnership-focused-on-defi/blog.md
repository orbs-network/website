[**Orbs,**](https://www.orbs.com/) an Israeli project developing a free, open-source, public blockchain infrastructure offering developers a proper mix of performance, cost, security and ease of use, and [**Krystal**](https://krystal.app/), a wallet for storing and exchanging cryptocurrency, earning passive income and accessing various DeFi applications in one place, announced a mutual cooperation and collaborations in the field of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).

Orbs recently announced its newest DeFi project: [**Liquidity Nexus**](https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service/). Liquidity Nexus utilizes [**single-sided farming**](https://www.orbs.com/single-sided-farming-on-any-dex-via-orbs-liquidity-nexus-part-1/), a novel DeFi protocol developed by the Orbs team, to enable liquidity farmers to provide ETH only and still participate in ETH/USDC liquidity pools.

Krystal is an advanced cryptocurrency wallet that provides an all-in-one DeFi platform, available on Android and iOS mobile apps. Krystal provides a frictionless and secure DeFi experience with the following key features:

- **Seamless token swap:** Integration to top DEX platforms, such as Kyber Network and Uniswap, to provide token swap functionality for about 30,736+ token pairs.
- **Token Lending for interest:** single-click lending and withdrawal services with AAVE and Compound to provide convenient lending services for any user.
- **Hassle-free portfolio management:** convenient portfolio management tools so that you can easily monitor and track your assets across multiple platforms and stay on top of your DeFi game.
- **Solid security:** Krystal is non-custodial and does not hold your assets at any time. All Krystal smart contracts have been fully audited by external third parties.

The Orbs and Krystal partnership may include, among other things, the listing, featuring and integration of the Orbs Token on the newly launched Krystal Wallet, as well as collaboration with respect to the creation of DeFi-related educational content and social media activities, and joint marketing and promotional activities for DeFi-related projects developed by each of the parties.
