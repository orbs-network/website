Due to the events surrounding Multichain last month including the [announcement](https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1677180114227056641) that the team behind the protocol will be suspending services, the Orbs community has been requesting a reliable alternative to Multichain for bridging their ORBS tokens. 

The main criteria for a new bridge is a high level of security, a stable project, and support of ORBS on all previously supported chains. In light of this criteria, Orbs has now been integrated with Axelar Satellite!

**About Axelar**

Axelar delivers secure cross-chain communication for Web3, enabling protocols to build Interchain dApps that grow beyond a single chain. Axelar is built on proof-of-stake, the battle-tested approach used by Ethereum, Polygon, Cosmos, and more. Cross-chain communication means projects can create a complete experience for their users that lets them interact with any asset, application, or chain with one click.


Satellite is a web application built on top of the Axelar Network. It provides an easy-to-use interface that enables users to transfer their crypto assets from one chain to another. The bridge has facilitated over 700,000 cross-chain transactions resulting in a total volume of [1.8 billion](https://axelarscan.io/interchain).   The Axelar protocol has ongoing security audits when major updates to the code base are changed, they can be viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/audits). 

For a complete list of supported assets, networks, and a 1-click network installation to MetaMask, refer to https://axelarscan.io/resources/chains
