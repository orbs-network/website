**We are excited to announce that the ORBS token is available on Rango, a leading Multi-chain DEX Aggregator!**

[Rango](https://rango.exchange/) is a popular DeFi protocol that enables all-in-one swap across multiple L-1 blockchains, such as ETH, BSC, Polygon, and more. Using the Rango cross-chain DEX aggregator, Orbs token holders can now easily bridge and swap ORBS between the leading DeFi DEX-AMMs protocols.

### Bridge & Swap in 1 Click

The Rango protocol optimizes token swaps across chains by finding the best available route for the requested transaction. In this way, Rango is able to achieve a high level of liquidity and as a result, optimal swap prices.

Let’s take a look at the following example - 

A user wants to swap Ethereum native ETH tokens to Orbs BEP20 tokens on BSC. Usually, to make this trade, the user would first need to find an Ethereum-BSC cross chain bridge, such as [AnySwap](https://anyswap.exchange/#/router) for example, to migrate his tokens. Then, he would need to find a suitable DEX with the relevant pools to make the swap.

Rango does all of this automatically, finding the optimal route to execute the swap. Using the intuitive Rango UI users can easily track the routing steps and know the estimated time of the swap to be completed.

### Interoperability is the Key

Since last year there has been a major expansion of the Orbs ecosystem, with a large focus on integrations with DeFi ecosystems. Orbs’ multi-chain interoperability plays a critical role in this initiative.

Following Orbs’ [latest integration](https://www.orbs.com/Orbs-Coming-to-Avalanche/) with the Avalanche network, Orbs is now live on all 5 major L-1 chains: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Solana, and Avalanche. This in turn accelerated the integration of the Orbs ecosystem with over 17 major DeFi protocols (such as UniSwap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, Kyber Networks, 1inch, Alpaca Finance, Beefy Finance, QuickSwap, DinoSwap, with more to come soon...).

Thanks to this massive expansion and the community’s participation, we can now see the results in the form of this latest addition of the Orbs token by the Rango platform. We expect many more exciting developments such as this that leverage Orbs as a multi-chain asset.
