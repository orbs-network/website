**Hey Orbs Community!**

With 2020 Kicking off to a great start for the Orbs team, I wanted to share some updates to the Orbs team structure and some exciting news about what to look forward to in the coming months. 

As you know, we launched the Orbs Universe back in March of 2019, since the launch, we have seen constant and significant growth, on a month to month basis to usage on Orbs Network. 

We have learned a lot about the network requirements and are extremely pleased with the stability, scalability, and security of the Orbs Network.

### Orbs Team Update


With the successful launch of the network behind us, we are shifting the development teams from building the network, to managing and automating it and consequently decided to make a few changes to the team structure: 

I will be taking on a more hands-on role in managing the Business Development, Marketing, and Operation teams, as well as being more actively engaged with the Orbs stakeholder community. My main focus will be bringing more and more companies to build their Blockchain-based products and solutions on the Orbs Network and onboarding additional participants to the Orbs ecosystem.  

Given my more central role, I have asked Uriel, my brother, partner, and Orbs Co-Founder, to step down from his hands-on role in day-to-day operations. Uriel will continue to work with the team as an external advisor while we build the Orbs Universe. In addition, I will be using Uriel's skills and knowledge to provide me with important industry insights that will help us achieve our goals. Rest assured that if I will need his help at Orbs at any time, I will use it :).

Orbs' Technical Co-Founder Tal Kol will be diving back, and even deeper, into our technology and manage the engineering and research teams. We are certain that with Tal's vast experience in building development teams for some of the world's leading tech companies, he will be able to lead the team to new heights in 2020. 

Co-founder Neta Korin will continue her work at the [Hexa Foundation](https://www.hexa.org/) focusing on government and educational efforts, in addition to helping me with business development efforts.

### Orbs PoS

I am extremely proud to share that we have not only achieved everything we set-up to do our 2019 research and development roadmap but are also slightly ahead of schedule :-) 

By the end of March, Orbs will launch the Orbs Staking Wallet, allowing token holders to manage their tokens, play an active role in bringing the Orbs Network to life and earn rewards for their contribution. 

Stay tuned for more exciting news from the Orbs team, and really look forward to a productive and successful 2020!

Yours,

**Daniel Peled**, 

Orbs Co-Founder
