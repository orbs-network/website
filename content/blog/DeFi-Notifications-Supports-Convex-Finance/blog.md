**The Open DeFi Notifications Protocol has integrated with Convex Finance, one of the biggest DeFi protocols with over $3B in TVL!**

[Convex Finance](https://www.convexfinance.com/) is one of the largest and well known DeFi protocols, ranked at [#7 by DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/), with over $3B in TVL. Convex allows Curve.fi liquidity providers to earn trading fees and claim boosted CRV without locking CRV themselves, for a better capital efficiency. 

Convex users can now use the Open DeFi Notifications Protocol to set up a **‘Staking Unlocked’** notification to be notified once their CVX tokens locking period has expired.

The [Open DeFi Notification Protocol](https://defi.org/notifications/) App is available on the [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp).

_The Open DeFi Notification Protocol by defi.org is a community led initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events._


### Don’t Miss an Unlocking Event

The Convex protocol enables its users to vote-lock their CVX tokens in order to participate and earn fees from Curve’s gauge voting mechanism. These tokens are locked for a period of minimum of 16 weeks. Once this time period is over, the tokens need to be re-locked in order to generate additional fees.

CVX's relatively long locking period can make it hard for users to track their unlocking events, especially for multiple locked token batches, thereby leaving their tokens sitting idle without generating fees.

Well, not anymore!

**Using the Open DeFi Notification Protocol, Convex users can set up a “Staking Unlocked” notification to alert them on their CVX unlocking events.**

### A Notification Standard for Leading DeFi Projects

The Open DeFi Notification Protocol is an open initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events. 

The addition of Convex makes for an impressive lineup of leading DeFi projects which have already been integrated into the Open DeFi Notification app for the benefit of their users, including, among others: Aave, Uniswap, SushiSwap, QuickSwap, PancakeSwap, and more…

**The app supports over 30 protocols across 7 networks: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Fantom, Cronos, Avalanche, and Arbitrum!**

The Protocol has been implemented fully by the [Orbs network](https://www.orbs.com/) and will be executed by the Orbs Guardians, making this the 1st fully decentralized implementation of a notification protocol.
