Lately, the Orbs team has been getting a lot of questions from people wondering about various tokens with similar names to Orbs that are out there in different DEXs and DEFI projects. This post will clarify the situation and serve as a resource to help the community avoid confusion as they do their own due diligence on the tokens they interact with.

The one and only token associated with the Orbs Network project is called **Orbs** and uses the ticker **ORBS**.

The Orbs token was designed as an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. This was done in large part because this project believes that a permissionless and decentralized blockchain provides a lot of benefits, and the Ethereum ecosystem in particular provides significant advantages as a layer in the Orbs Network’s hybrid model.

However, the fact that Ethereum is decentralized and permissionless also means that anyone in the world can create whatever ERC20 token they want, with whatever name they want. This is true even for those who create fake versions of existing tokens or tokens that claim to represent projects that don’t have a token.

This means that there are other ERC20 tokens out there that look like Orbs Tokens at first glance, such as OrbMAX, OrbS, OrbV2, Orb and even one inactive ERC-20 token that uses Orbs as its name and ORBS as its ticker. These tokens are not connected or related to the project in any way. Some of these may be real projects that happen to use a similar name, others are unfortunately trying to create a fake version of our token and deceive people.

Everyone who uses Ethereum needs to take responsibility for their own actions and security. It is extremely important that you always check to make sure that you are interacting with the right ERC20 token. The following information can be used to do a proper check.

The one and only contract address on Ethereum for the Orbs Token is: **0xff56cc6b1e6ded347aa0b7676c85ab0b3d08b0fa**.

This is by far the best and most reliable way to check that the token you are interacting with is the real Orbs Token.

Other indicators you can use to check are as follows (but some of the unrelated tokens use one or more of these, so don’t use them on their own):

- Name: Orbs
- Ticker: ORBS
- Total Supply: 10,000,000,000
- Official Website: [https://www.orbs.com/](https://www.orbs.com/)

Specifically when using Etherscan and Uniswap, another thing to be careful of is that these platforms are case sensitive when doing searches. Therefore make sure to use the name **Orbs** rather than any other name.
