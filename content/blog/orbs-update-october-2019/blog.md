Weeeeelcome back everyone! After a quiet summer, this past month of September was crazy busy for the Orbs team from the Tel Aviv events at the start till the Seoul events at the end. Feels great being back in full swing, and without further ado, here‚Äôs a short summary of what‚Äôs been happening:

### Tel Aviv Blockchain Week

Kicking off the month was Tel Aviv Blockchain week, with Ethereal Summit being the crown jewel. With the home-court advantage, the Orbs team‚Äôs sponsorship took a major presence at the events. Tal Kol spoke to a full house on the main day, which was followed by a celebratory event in collaboration with eToro and iAngels..

Aside from the honor to present the Orb vision to some of the industry‚Äôs most reputable figures, and the business opportunities budding from the day‚Äôs meetings, it was overall a fun event! Good job everyone :)

### Block TV Founder Interview

During the Ethereal event, the wonderful folks at Block TV conducted an interview with Orbs‚Äô technical founder Tal Kol before his ascension to the main stage. The channels‚Äô Yael Lavie and Tal discussed the Orbs vision of turning digital accountability into user trust in businesses who rely on blockchain.

### UN Hackathon: Orbs for the Win!

There was lots of anticipation leading up to the GBBC‚Äôs (Global Blockchain Business Council) ‚ÄúHack the SDGs‚Äù United Nations hackathon. Orbs team members Rani and Jonathan flew into NYC to partake in this important event, teaching young talent how to develop on the Orbs network.

Ultimately, the winner of the hackathon chose to rely on the Orbs blockchain for their project! Considering that the other infrastructure providers¬† participating in the Hackathon were Microsoft, IBM, and Quorum, this is great news for the Orbs project which has been prioritizing usability since the get-go. Major kudos to the delegation for doing such an amazing job.

### Blockchain Education Webinars

One of our highlights from the UN SDG‚Äôs Hackathon was the opportunity to host a dev webinar to participants around the globe. Sergei and Jonathan conducted a live video demonstration to the public, educating on the Orbs blockchain and how to get started with developing on it.

Orbs team representatives¬† also held an additional webinar, for the first time, to the developers community in Silicon Valley. This webinar included an introduction to the Orbs blockchain, getting started using the Orbs Starter Kit, overview of tooling and more.

A recording of the webinar will be available soon on the Orbs website.

### New Orbs Center in Korea

Congratulations all around: The shiny new Orbs Center for Blockchain has officially been opened as part of the Crypto Community Center in Seoul!

Gearing up for Korea Blockchain Week 2019, Orbs representatives in Korea opened the doors to a brand new center for blockchain education in the city center. The center was built to act as an embassy for the technology in general as well as a place to learn more about the future of business use of the Orbs blockchain.

The opening event was a full house, and I‚Äôd like to personally invite our readers to come by for a visit :)

### ORBS on Metamask ü¶ä

I‚Äôm happy to announce that the staking of ORBS is now easier than ever before, as the token is now searchable on Metamask. Metamask is a popular tool for interacting with Ethereum and ERC20 coins and tokens easily:

### Enterprise Use-Case Panel

Orbs team members participated in a very interesting Blockchain Enterprise Use Cases panel as part of Blockchain bridge SF conference¬† in San Francisco on September 18-19, 2019. Together with AB Inbev, (the world's biggest brewing company) and Strongblock.

Gili discussed the required features for enterprise blockchain: Decentralization, immutability, transparency, cheaper than existing technologies and faster than current solutions and the latest use cases.

### Crypto Connection Conference

On September 12th the Orbs team‚Äôs trading representative Ilan Sterk moderated a fascinating panel in New York on the topic of _"Crypto Connection 2019 - Where the Institutional and Crypto Markets connect"_. The exceptional panelists were from Gemini Exchange, ErisX Exchange, Hudson River Trading and Murphy & McGonigle.

The panel focused primarily on the use of exchanges and trading platforms, institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, OTC products and regulations.

### KOSDAQ Delegation

As part of the KOSDAQ (Korean Stock Exchange) delegation's visit to Israel, organized by the Yozma Group, Orbs team had the honor of hosting heads of some of Korea's top companies at the HQ in Tel Aviv, demonstrating the project and the Orbs vision as well as showcasing the value of blockchain. The evening was a wonderful gathering will of business potential, and I‚Äôd like to thank the attendees for coming to hear about this important project.

### Korea Blockchain Week

The past week was Korea Blockchain Week in Seoul.

It kicked off with a meetup at the new Crypto Community Center, co-sponsored by Orbs and located at the heart of Seoul‚Äôs Gangnam quarter. Over 300 people attended the event, hosted by the Orbs team and Bitgosu. The event was live streamed on YouTube to the Korean community.

Aside for our permanent booth, we plan on holding meetups on a regular basis, to better engage with our community and reach out to new audience.

The main event of KBW was D.Fine conference. Orbs was a gold sponsor, with a keynote speech by Daniel and one of the largest booths in the exhibition . Among the speakers were acclaimed industry figures like Nick Szabo, Adam Back, Michael Novogratz, Silvio Micali and others, attracting more than 1,500 attendees. The event was successful, given the interesting meetings we had with potential partners. More to come about our new partnerships in future updates.
