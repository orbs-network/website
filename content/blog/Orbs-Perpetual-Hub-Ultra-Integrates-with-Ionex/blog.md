Ionex, a newly launched DEX by [DefiZoo](https://www.defizoo.fi/), long-time builders leveraging Orbs protocols, has integrated Perpetual Hub Ultra, powered by Orbs, bringing institutional grade perpetual futures trading to [Plasma](https://x.com/Plasma/). This integration positions Orbs technology as the go-to solution for DEXs seeking a plug-and-play perps infrastructure to expand their current offerings.

With this upgrade, Ionex users gain access to deep liquidity, customizable leverage, and efficient execution, all through a fully managed, modular perps stack.

Powered by Orbs’ Layer-3 infrastructure, this deployment builds on successful integrations of Perpetual Hub \[legacy\], cementing Orbs as the industry standard for turnkey perps infrastructure in DeFi.

[*Orbs*](https://www.orbs.com/) *is a decentralized infrastructure layer executed by a public network of permissionless validators using dPoS, staked with tens of millions of dollars in total value locked (TVL). Orbs Layer-3 infrastructure optimizes on-chain trading by providing aggregated liquidity, advanced trading orders, and decentralized derivatives, enabling a DeFi trading experience as efficient as CeFi.*

## **About Perpetual Hub Ultra**

Perpetual Hub Ultra is a fully integrated perpetual futures trading protocol developed by Orbs and Symm.io. It provides everything needed by DEXs looking to launch a high-performance perps platform, including hedging, liquidation, oracles, and a professional grade UI, all powered by Orbs’ Layer 3 decentralized infrastructure and Symm.io’s smart contract system.

Built for scalability and capital efficiency, once integrated, Ultra enables platforms to route liquidity from both onchain and offchain sources, including major centralized exchanges like Binance. This allows protocols to offer deep execution without needing to build a specialized chain or complex backend. By packaging the full perps stack into a modular integration layer, Ultra allows DEXs, frontends, and aggregators to deploy perps with minimal development effort and fast time to market.

As intent based trading continues to dominate DEX volume in spot markets, Perpetual Hub Ultra brings this same model to perps, enabling a new generation of trading venues to compete with centralized exchanges in performance, flexibility, and user experience while remaining fully decentralized.
