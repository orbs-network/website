In an exciting development for the Orbs project, the ORBS token has been added to the Orbit Bridge, which supports 19 different chains, including TON (The Open Network).

In addition, Megaton Finance has announced Orbs as an official launch partner to its much anticipated AMM-DEX on TON, planned to launch in January 2023! 

**Both these integrations mean that the ORBS token can now be bridged to the TON blockchain with liquidity pools and swap functions coming very soon!**


### Orbs Added to Orbit Bridge 

‌[Orbit Bridge](https://bridge.orbitchain.io/) by Ozys is an interchain communication protocol that allows communication between heterogeneous blockchains using Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) technology. 

Learn more about Orbit Bridge [here](https://bridge.orbitchain.io/questions).

Orbit Bridge IBC allows different blockchains to communicate with each other using Orbit Chain. Through this, users can utilize the various assets of various chains in all dApps through simple transactions on each chain:

- **Sending cross-chain data between heterogeneous chains:** Users can send assets or data to any chain connected to Orbit Bridge.
- **Trustless, Secure Multiple-Signature Verification:** All consensus happens on-chain, and all authority throughout this process is decentralized.
- **Fast, Secure Consensus Process:** The consensus process is smart contract-based and goes through Orbit Chain. 

To date, the Orbit Bridge has processed more than $12B in total bridge volume, holds almost $200M in TVL and is connected to 19 different networks with 85 tokens supported.

Megaton Finance aims to become a link that connects the TON blockchain to the DeFi ecosystem by connecting it with other Layer 1 chains, such as Ethereum. Coming in January 2023, Megaton Finance is planned to be the first autonomous financial protocol within the TON network that provides yield farming opportunities such as swaps and pair deposits.

Megaton Finance plans to become more than only an AMM mechanism protocol that provides revenue, its goal is to be the main gateway to Web 3.0 through continued upgrades and integration with Telegram in the future.


### Solidifying Orbs Presence on TON 

The [expansion](https://www.orbs.com/Expanding-to-The-Open-Network-TON/) of the Orbs network to The Open Network (TON) ecosystem was recently announced.

As an L3 infrastructure layer, Orbs can serve as a key TON ecosystem participant that is implementing new L3 use cases for protocols running on top of TON. The emerging TON ecosystem has much room for Orbs’ innovations and huge potential for capturing exciting opportunities and becoming the first movers.

Two services using Orbs’ technology were recently launched on TON: [TON Minter](https://www.orbs.com/Announcing-TON-Minter-by-Orbs/), named the official tool for deploying Jettons (alt tokens) on TON, and [TON Verifier](https://www.orbs.com/Announcing-TON-Verifier-by-Orbs/), an open-source application to publish verified source code for on-chain contracts on the TON chain powered by Orbs. 

This latest integration of Orbs by Orbit Bridge and the upcoming listing and liquidity pools of ORBS on Megaton Finance will further solidify the Orbs community’s presence on the TON blockchain as a major contributor to the TON ecosystem.
