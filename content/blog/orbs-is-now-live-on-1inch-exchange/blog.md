The 1inch protocol provides aggregation information services on exchange protocols and networks. The core part of the protocol is the 1inch v3 smart contract, which performs runtime verification of transaction execution, and the Pathfinder algorithm, which finds the best trading paths across multiple markets, taking gas costs into account.

To date, 1inch has executed transactions worth over $50B in total volume, with over 240k total users and 2.3M in total trades. 1inch is connected to 3 networks (Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon), with over 88 liquidity sources.
