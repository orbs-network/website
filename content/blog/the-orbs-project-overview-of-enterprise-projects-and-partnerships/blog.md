## The Orbs Project:

The Orbs Project is uniquely positioned in the blockchain-based solution landscape as it is the only public blockchain infrastructure with a live mainnet that is designed for enterprise use-cases. We believe that targeting enterprises is the best path to unlocking mainstream adoption for public blockchains.

During the last year and a half, since the Orbs mainnet launch, the Orbs team has been hard at work with numerous enterprises and design partner in exploring various use-cases and applications. In this blog post we'll explore some of the use-cases and partnerships the Orbs team is currently working on.

### **1\. Telecom: Communications Business Automation Network (CBAN)**

Orbs has been chosen, along with other industry members, such as Consensys and Corda, to [participate in the CBAN initiative](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwolfson/2019/06/25/ibm-orbs-consensys-work-together-on-global-blockchain-settlement-platform-for-telecoms/#571e1d75782c). CBAN was initiated by the [GLF](https://interactive.itwglf.com/ITW-Global-Leaders-Forum) (Global Leaders Forum), the main collaboration forum for the wholesale telecom business, backed by some of the biggest telecom carriers globally, including names like Orange, Deutsche Telekom, and Telefonica.

The goal of the CBAN is to improve operational efficiencies, accelerate product portfolio enrichment and create new revenue streams for telecom carriers. This will be accomplished through the creation of a blockchain-based infrastructure enabling automation of inter-carrier settlements.

### **2\. Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC)**

The GBBC is the leading industry association for the blockchain technology ecosystem, which brings together innovative organizations and founding thought-leaders from over 40 countries to advance understanding of blockchain technology amongst global regulators and business leaders.

The GBBC chose to [highlight Orbs in its newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/375bbc486441/latham-watkins-releases-book-of-blockchain-and-crypto-jargon-april-12-2019) that goes out to GBBC members, board, founding advisors, government officials and business leaders from around the world.

Orbs is extremely proud to be a member of such an esteemed organization, aiding to advance the benefits of blockchain technology around the world. Some of Orbs activities as part of the GBBC include [evangelizing Blockchain to the US Congress](https://www.orbs.com/demo-day-on-the-hill-takeaways/), [participating in UN hackathons](https://www.orbs.com/un-hackathon-afterthought/), [speaking on GBBC’s panels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8SfZgS3fmM&list=PLMF0XVogr1JSyKGRlq8OUWuBRe-QU86S8&index=14), and more.

Over the last couple of months, since the outbreak of the COVID-19 Virus, Orbs has been developing in cooperation with the GBBC a Blockchain-Based Health Passport. Listen to Ran Melamed, Orbs' Head of Business Development, give a presentation on the Global Blockchain Business Council's (GBBC) Virtual Members Forum.

### **3\. World Economic Forum (WEF) membership**

Orbs is a WEF Global Innovator, and as such is proud to participate in WEF events and initiatives around the world. Such events include:

- sitting on the WEF’s [Council for Humanitarian Systems](https://www.weforum.org/communities/the-future-of-the-humanitarian-system), a group of twenty global leaders across sectors (business, government, and non-profit) presently dealing with humanitarian issues
- participated in a [World Economic Forum workshop held at KAIST](https://www.orbs.com/orbs-update-december-2019/) (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) campus in Daejeon, Korea

Orbs has been working with the World Bank on [traceability of loan disbursements](https://www.orbs.com/orbs-update-march-2020/). The Hexa Foundation, employing Orbs blockchain, has been in discussions with multiple organizations and governments regarding the use of blockchain technology for the tracking of funds, in order to ensure that future aid funds do reach their desired destinations.

### **4\. Supply Chains Track & Trace Solution**

The Orbs team is working in collaboration with a leading US-based manufacturer on a track & trace solution built on top of the Orbs blockchain. The solution will provide a comprehensive tool to track each product as it leaves the manufacturing plant line up until the point of sale. Such a solution has the potential to effectively mitigate real pain points such as counterfeits, stolen goods, brand protection issues, and more, which all eventually lead to substantial loss of revenue.

Private blockchains, such as [IBM Hyperledger](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/industries/supply-chain), also offer supply chain management solutions. However, they lack the ability to offer multiple partners with guarantees of inclusiveness, fairness, and best economic value. Orbs believes that in the long run, the future will favor public blockchain-based solutions because of reasons such as guarantees, interoperability, permissionless open protocols, and more.

### **5\. Document notarization**

Document notarization is the ability of blockchain to provide an immutable document and content registry that cannot be manipulated. In this space we are providing solutions for media companies with regards to content provenance and fighting fake news, accounting software providers for invoice notarization, verification of academic certificates and more.

The Linet virtual chain is a receipts notarization application leveraging Orbs public blockchain to provide proofs of an immutable and in-time generation of client receipts.

### **6\. Yes24**

[YES24](http://www.yes24.com/), Korea’s largest online bookstore, [announced](http://www.zdnet.co.kr/view/?no=20191105102439) the launch of [sey Chain](https://www.sey.io/), the retail giant’s private blockchain and token, based on the Orbs technology.
