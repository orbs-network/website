**QuickSwap, Polygon’s top DEX and the first integration of Orbs Liquidity Hub, is making its debut on Base and bringing Liquidity Hub along for the ride\!**

With this launch, QuickSwap traders on Base gain access to Orbs’ advanced L3 Liquidity Hub technology, tapping into a wider pool of liquidity from both on-chain and off-chain sources to secure the most competitive pricing. 

Liquidity Hub on Base delivers key advantages such as better execution prices, MEV protection, gasless transactions, improved capital efficiency, and an intuitive trading interface, all designed to streamline the trading experience. 

This expansion not only enhances trading on QuickSwap’s new Base deployment but also grows Orbs’ presence across major ecosystems, offering traders more efficiency and flexibility than ever before.

[*Orbs*](https://www.orbs.com/) *is a decentralized protocol executed by a public network of permissionless validators using PoS, staked with tens of millions of dollars in TVL. The protocol optimizes on-chain trading with L3 use cases that include aggregated liquidity, advanced trading orders, and decentralized derivatives, enabling a DeFi trading experience as efficient as CeFi.*

## How Liquidity Hub Works

Liquidity Hub is a [layer 3 (L3)](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-layer-3s-crypto) infrastructure software powered by Orbs that provides an optimization layer above the AMM.   
This technology taps external liquidity for better price quotes and lower price impact.

Instead of the typical swap that searches for the best route within the DEX's limited liquidity pools, Liquidity Hub enhances this process by utilizing additional liquidity sources:

1) **On-chain solver auction:** Third-party solvers who compete to fill swaps using on-chain liquidity like AMM pools or their private inventory.

2) **Decentralized orders via API:** Decentralized orders are accessible using API, enabling institutional/professional traders, such as market makers, to submit bids and compete to fill swaps.

The Liquidity Hub protocol, powered by [Orbs L3 technology](https://www.orbs.com/overview/), has become the industry standard for achieving the best price across ecosystems.

Headliners include SwapX, THENA, Lynex, IntentX, and Fenix, among others.
