**The Open DeFi Notifications Protocol has integrated with Pendle Finance, a rapidly growing DeFi project with $168M TVL!**

Pendle Finance is a fast-growing DeFi project, increasing TVL from $16M to $168M since the start of this year according to [DeFillama](https://defillama.com/protocol/pendle). Pendle is a decentralized finance protocol that allows users to tokenize and sell future yields.

Pendle users can now set up a **‘New Market’** notification to receive real-time updates when a new market has been deployed. 

The [Open DeFi Notification Protocol](https://defi.org/notifications/) App is available on the [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp).

_The Open DeFi Notification Protocol by defi.org is a community led initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events._


### Stay up to date with new markets 

The Pendle protocol enables its users to purchase select yield-bearing assets without the yield, resulting in a cheaper price. Tokens can then be redeemed for full value at a later date, once the yield has matured. Markets are enabled by Pendle Pro allowing users to swap between PT & YT assets and execute yield strategies. 

With new markets being created and old ones expiring due to maturity dates it is a lot to keep track of and traders can miss out on potential opportunities if they don’t keep up with Pendle’s market website on a frequent basis. Adding to the complication, Pendle supports multiple markets across Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Binance Smart Chain, splitting attention even further. 

Traders will no longer miss out!

### A Notification Standard for Leading DeFi Projects

The Open DeFi Notification Protocol is an open initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events. 

The addition of Pendle makes for an impressive lineup of leading DeFi projects which have already been integrated into the Open DeFi Notification app for the benefit of their users, including, among others: Aave, Uniswap, SushiSwap, QuickSwap, PancakeSwap, and more…

**The app supports over 30 protocols across 7 networks: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Fantom, Cronos, Avalanche, and Arbitrum!**
