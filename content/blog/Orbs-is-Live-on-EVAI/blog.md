**We are excited to announce that Orbs is now live on the EVAI platform, a world-class decentralised ratings platform for crypto, DeFi and NFT-based assets.**

Unlike traditional, centralised ratings platforms, [Evai](https://evai.io/) is a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) for evaluation of crypto assets. Evai provides decentralised and impartial ratings based on a multi-factor Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning (ML) model that removes the need for human intervention, thereby avoiding any tendency to bias. EVAI constantly optimise the ratings system to provide crypto users with impartial data in order to aid them make informed decisions.

Crypto users can now find the ORBS token on the EVAI platform -

### The EVAI Rating Criteria

The EVAI ratings are designated on an alphabetical scale ranging from A1 to D. The Evai A1 rating ("A1") denotes crypto assets of the highest technical and quantitative characteristics, while a "D" score indicates an unstable technical foundation and high risk.

**Orbs was rated for a few days with the second highest rating of A2!**

As can be seen in the table below, Orbs was classified by EVAI as an excellent quality crypto asset, with a very solid financial composition and moderately low risk. Please note that no crypto asset is currently rated as A1, so this rating means that EVAI rated Orbs in the same category as the best crypto assets currently available on the market. This ratings move pretty fast anc change everyday, so you keep track. Today Orbs was rated B1, which is still pretty solid and considered low risk, we hope to get back to A Ratings in the next rating round!

### Powered by AI and ML

EVAI enables its users to gain unique insights on the crypto market by usingÂ  a multi-factor ratings model built on academic research, AI and ML.

Evai ratings draw from an infinite combination of over 9 major market factors to determine the most statistically significant in identifying risk and capturing long term asset value. These factors include among others: Liquidity, sentiment, volatility, Utility, Risk, and more. Each factor is in turn powered by multiple indicators. For example, Sharpe ratio and Sortino ratio to measure volatility.

All of the input data is fed into the EVAI machine to produce the EVAI global rating system based on the most statistically significant factors.
