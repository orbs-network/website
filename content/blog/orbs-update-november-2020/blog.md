Hi everyone!

This month has seen tremendous progress for Orbs in the DeFi space:

The first DeFi grant was approved and awarded to Paradigm, who are already hard at work creating liquidity pools on major DEXs such as Uniswap and Balancer.

In addition, Orbs co-founder Tal Kol, will be given a thought-provoking presentation on Orbs and DeFi strategies in the upcoming KBW 2020. You do not want to miss it!

On this and more in this month's update, here we go...

## Paradigm DeFi Grant Approved!

![](/assets/img/blog/orbs-update-november-2020/photo_2020-11-02_13-47-42-1030x438.jpg)

We are excited to announce the first DeFi project to receive a grant as part of the [Orbs Ecosystem Grant Program (OEGP)](https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/orbs-grant-program-2/)

A detailed project proposal was submitted by [Paradigm](https://paradigmfund.io/#1), and approved by the Orbs OEGP committee after careful evaluation. The goal of the project is to provide liquidity for the ORBS token using decentralized liquidity DEX protocols such as Uniswap and Balancer.

The Orbs team is extremely enthusiastic to kickstart this project with Paradigm!

Liquidity provisioning has proven to be an invaluable DeFi tool with popular projects like Uniswap, Balancer and Curve, offering decentralized programmable liquidity. Enhancing Orbs’ integration into these platforms will provide an important stepping stone to future DeFi projects.

See this [blog post](https://medium.com/paradigm-fund/establishment-of-amm-division-with-orbs-as-the-first-community-founders-letter-d40ac234a197) by Paradigm for more information about this project.

### **ORBS on Uniswap - and what's next?**

ORBS is already listed on Uniswap, and anyone can provide liquidity to the pool and start sharing revenue from commissions!

Commission of 0.3% is collected from all trades and is distributed to liquidity providers in proportion to the funds that they contributed to the pool.

You can provide liquidity for ORBS/ETH liquidity pool [here.](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/ETH/0xff56Cc6b1E6dEd347aA0B7676C85AB0B3D08B0FA)

For more information, and how to become a liquidity provider on Uniswap, see [here.](https://orbsdefi.substack.com/p/orbs-on-uniswap-and-whats-next)

Expect more updates soon!

## Locking of Team’s Tokens

As previously announced, as part of the team’s commitment to a fair and transparent ecosystem and as an act of the team’s commitment to the vested interest of the Orbs Network and Universe, the team has voluntarily elected to place the entire team pool under the same locking mechanism that applies to all staking participants in the Orbs Proof-of-Stake Universe.

This month, we have executed on this commitment. The entire team pool has been transferred to the same staking smart contract used by all Guardians and Delegators. You can view the staking transaction here:

[https://etherscan.io/tx/0xde2c2426897e3d3a20e59824cc44ca7340d06cab0f9f411a14f25d4f63e07f47](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xde2c2426897e3d3a20e59824cc44ca7340d06cab0f9f411a14f25d4f63e07f47)

As noted previously, the team tokens will not be participating in any PoS elections and will not share in the PoS staking rewards divided among Delegators and Guardians.

## State of the Network

The team at Citadel posted on their [twitter](https://twitter.com/CitadelDAO/status/1318869509168631808?s=20) this awesome Orbs weekly metrics report. It tracks the most important Orbs Network metrics and indices, such as daily transfer amounts, number of guardians, participating stake and more.

As always, here is our monthly reminder to all the ORBS Delegators:

### Remember to Lock Your Tokens to get Rewards

**FROM NOW ON ONLY LOCKED TOKENS WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR STAKING REWARDS**

![](/assets/img/blog/orbs-update-november-2020/lock-your-tokens-1030x611.jpg)

Be sure to stake your tokens using the new Tetra wallet:

[https://staking.orbs.network/](https://staking.orbs.network/)

You can make sure that your tokens are properly locked here:

[https://orbs-network.github.io/voting/reward](https://orbs-network.github.io/voting/reward)

Learn more about the locking mechanism:

...

## Orbs on CoinGecko!

You can now find [Orbs on CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/orbs)!

Being listed on coingecko boosts the credentials of the ORBS token and helps with various registration procedures with DeFi protocols. An important achievement!

## **Media highlights**

### Does DeFi Hold a Promise for the Unbanked?

With the rise of cryptocurrencies in the last few years, also came the increased optimism that billions of people in the global unbanked population would finally have an inclusive financial solution.

Can the rise of DeFi and stablecoins really provide hope for the world’s unbanked? Read this excellent blog post by the Hexa Foundation:

## **Meet the Orbs Team Vlog**

We think it's important for the community to get to know the team members better, as well as receive constant updates on the work that’s been done.

In this latest episode, Bar interviews Noam Berg from the Orbs R&D team. Noam presents a new analytics tool he's working on for the new Orbs Proof-of-Stake V2.5. Very cool stuff!
