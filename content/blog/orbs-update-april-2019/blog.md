All right everyone, we’ve had a crazy busy month with the launch and constant news, so this month’s update is going to be sweet, short and to the point. First things first:

## **ORBS IS LIVE!**

After so many months of hard work and sleeping under desks, the Orbs blockchain is up, running, and purring like a cat. We would like to take this moment to thank our wonderful (and strikingly handsome) community all over the globe for everything they have been doing to support this massive endeavor!

You can find more on the launch of Orbs network by checking out these posts from last week:

## **Events**

**Of the events from this past month:**

### **YOZMA meetup**

### **Korea**

No month is complete without stopping by our favorite Korea! We traveled on the 28th to an Orbs launch event in Seoul to announce the release of our production layer and Validator – Delegator – Guardian ecosystem, as well as the ORBS token distribution (with a presentation by Daniel). Later we ceremoniously signed our agreement with Yes24, Korea’s #1 online bookstore. Finally, Orbs hosted a panel discussion with six famed Korean Influencers (traders and Youtubers) on the topic of blockchain tech mainstream adoption.

With around 700 attendees, the event was a great success, and even fun! The event was livestreamed, you can watch a recording of Daniel's presentation below (apologies for the shoddy audio):

### **Japan**

Towards the end of the month, we made a visit to Japan. The event was held at Liquid’s beautiful Tokyo offices where our President Daniel Peled presented to a group of ~80 investors, engineers and corporate representatives from the tech sector on Orbs’ network and the open-source revolution, and our very own Mayo Hotta _(Hi Mayo!)_ explained in more details about Orbs’ business progress and PoS universe and answered audience questions.

Our Head of Partnerships Danny Brown Wolf spoke to an audience of global companies, including Nvidia, Nasdaq, Microsoft, and GE as well as delegates from Israel’s Ministry of Economy and Industry about the Orbs strategy and vision in the days leading to the network’s launch.
