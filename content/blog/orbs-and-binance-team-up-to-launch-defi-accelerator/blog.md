Orbs, an Israeli company developing a public blockchain infrastructure for real businesses, and Binance, the global blockchain company behind the world's largest digital asset exchange, announced that they are teaming up to promote innovation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space by serving as the first core sponsors of the DeFi.org accelerator, which bootstraps new projects and DeFi protocols.

The DeFi.org Accelerator is dedicated to supporting research, development of open-source software, and community engagement. The accelerator looks for projects that are built on the principles of fair distribution, community ownership, innovation, responsible approach to risk, sustainable economics and composability with the broader ecosystem.

Participants get a variety of benefits, including mentorship, funding opportunities, and market exposure. In addition, DeFi.org Accelerator participants will receive special consideration if they apply to participate in Binance’s seed fund for Bridging DeFi and CeFi or receive a grant under the Orbs Grant Program.

The mentors of DeFi.org work in the areas of Product/UX, cryptoeconomics, solidity, front-end development, and community/marketing.

Orbs and Binance are excited about working together with breakthrough teams to create innovation and drive the DeFi ecosystem forward and invite the entire blockchain ecosystem to consider joining the accelerator as co-sponsors or mentors.

Interested teams can apply to participate at [https://defi.org/](https://defi.org/).
