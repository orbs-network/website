### San Francisco Blockchain Week!

Last week we participated in San Francisco Blockchain Week (SFBW), of which the Orbs team was an event sponsor:¬† Throughout the week we met dozens of giant enterprises from multiple industries (media, mobile, CPG, chemicals, telecom and more) and various countries (US, Japan, Germany, Korea, etc). Meetings were serious and structured, we truly felt how enterprises are getting more mature and realistic on how to unlock the promise of blockchain technology and how to achieve trust at scale.

On top of the back to back meetings, we held an enterprise summit, an initiative led by the Orbs team. The event was focused on the state of the industry, discussed different use cases and get different perspectives. We presented the Orbs vision and technology, then had a long discussion as part of a panel with some of the stakeholders of the industry (Salesforce, Consensys).¬† The event included dinner and networking, attracting dozens of the biggest enterprises worldwide.

### Hexa at the World Economic Forum meetup in Dubai!

Cofounder Netta Korin was invited by the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting of Global Future Councils to sit on their Global Future Council on the Humanitarian System.

The group met in Dubai November 3rd and 4th and discussed ways in which global humanitarian solutions could be made more efficient. Netta shared insights from her experience at the Hexa Foundation, which aims to leverage blockchain in order to create social impact.¬† Several of the Foundation's projects work towards assisting governments and NGOs to become more transparent and efficient in their giving efforts, and Netta was happy to share experiences with the WEF.

We look forward to a wonderful partnership with an inspiring group of leaders and we are very proud that Netta is a part of this effort.

### SecurePro Partnership in Hong Kong

The Orbs team partnered with [SecurePro](http://www.securepro.com.hk/?uid=0.3.0.0), a leading SI from Hong Kong, to submit a solution in one of Hong Kong‚Äôs Smart Government Innovation Lab open tenders. The joint offer focused on developing a blockchain-based solution for the transfer of trademark ownership. This solution combines Securepro‚Äôs technological expertise and experience in working with the Hong Kong government along with the Orbs permissionless blockchain platform.

This call for innovation is merely one of several additional projects in which we‚Äôre now partnering with Securepro, who‚Äôs specializing in providing security and automation solutions for government, corporates and NGOs.
