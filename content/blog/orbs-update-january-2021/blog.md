## State of the Network

Orbs PoS V2.5: The Age of Guardians, has introduced many new features into the Orbs PoS Universe. A key component of which is empowering the Orbs Guardians to take a more active role in building and maintaining the Orbs Network.

These added responsibilities of the Orbs Guardians make it extra-important for Delegators to properly choose a Guardian, who will look after the network and his Delegators' best interests.

Here is a short guide for the Orbs Delegators on choosing a Guardian:

The last month saw some significant spikes in gas prices on the Ethereum network. This led to a lively discussion in the [Orbs official telegram channel](https://t.me/OrbsNetwork) on this subject.

[Orbs PoS V2.5 release](https://www.orbs.com/v2-5-update-combating-the-gas-storms/) already introduced major improvements to the protocol that brought about a significant reduction of Ethereum gas consumption across the Orbs Universe. Nonetheless, the Orbs team is monitoring and analyzing this issue from a technological viewpoint, and are examining additional improvements to be presented to the community for possible implementation.

In the meantime, the following blog explains the importance of the Orbs proof of stake design on Ethereum, and provides guidelines to Orbs delegators on how to be efficient with gas usage and thereby significantly reduce costs associated with gas prices.

## Orbs Team Updates

The Orbs Team celebrated the new year with a toast in the new offices, and what a year it has been -

Orbs PoS V2.5: The Age of Guardians has been a huge milestone by the team and an overall momentous occasion in the history of the Orbs Network (second only to the Orbs mainnet launch back in 2019). The new mechanism places the Orbs PoS architecture at the forefront of public blockchain infrastructure projects.

The transition has also been extremely successful, for both Guardians and Delegators, which emphasizes the resilience and commitment of the Orbs community.

There was other important progress in various fields such as defi; we are now beginning to see the fruits of that hard work with the Binance partnership.

Overall, 2020 was an important year for Orbs in terms of building and strengthening the fundamentals of the project.

We wish all of the Orbs community a happy new year!

May the coming year bring you happiness and health!
