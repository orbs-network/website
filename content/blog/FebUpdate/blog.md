**Orbs Builds the World's First Multi-Chain Staking with Ethereum and Polygon**

![](/assets/img/blog/FebUpdate/image1.jpg)

As you know, Orbs utilizes Proof-of-Stake to secure its consensus layer. The newest development is that Orbs is building the world's first Multi-Chain Staking, with both Ethereum and Polygon. To pioneer this vision,.

So, how does this work under the hood? let's do a short recap of the Orbs PoS mechanism:

🌐 Orbs V1: Launched in March 2019, the first version of Orbs Proof-of-Stake ran as an Orbs virtual chain executed by Orbs' own validators, similar to other popular PoS networks like EOS, Tezos and Cosmos.

🌐 Orbs V2: Introduced Orbs innovative hybrid model of PoS over PoW, by adding the security of Ethereum's PoW to verify the Orbs' election results. By harnessing the power of Ethereum, we utilized Ethereum's own ironclad security to increase the security of our own protocol.

🌐 Orbs V3: PoS over Ethereum + PoS over Polygon is setting a new bar --- expanding PoS elections to Polygon and creating the world's first PoS multi-chain implementation that spans 3 chains: Orbs, Ethereum and Polygon!

**The Open DeFi Notification Protocol adds support for Alpaca Finance and Pangolin**

![](/assets/img/blog/FebUpdate/image4.jpg)

🌐The Open DeFi Notification Protocol, powered by Orbs, now supports [AlpacaFinance](https://www.alpacafinance.org/) (has over $800M in TVL), the largest lending protocol for leveraged yield farming (LYF) on BSC.

🌐Opening an LYF position carries certain risks, primarily the risk of liquidation.

🌐Using the [Open DeFi Notification Protocol,](https://defi.org/notifications/) users who take a loan can now set up a "position health" notification which will issue an alert once their safety buffer drops below a specified threshold. In this way, users have 24/7 monitoring of their position health!

🌐[Pangolin  ](https://pangolin.exchange/)users can also receive real-time notifications for their positions to better manage their trading strategies and risk.

🌐There are currently two types of Notifications available for Pangolin:

1.  Pending Reward: Get notified when your PNG farming or staking rewards are above a specified threshold.

2.  Position Worth: Track your open positions total worth to take profit or to protect against losses.

![](/assets/img/blog/FebUpdate/image7.jpg)

🌐 Orbs PoS V3 multi-chain staking proposal on Ethereum and Polygon addresses the key feedback from the community following the V2 launch: the substantial increase in ETH price and soaring gas prices for Orbs Delegators.

🌐 One of the action items for Orbs PoS V3 was revamping [Tetra](https://staking.orbs.network/), the official staking wallet by the Orbs team. As part of this revamp, the Orbs team also addressed an additional feedback from the community regarding the staking flow - specifically the "Approval" step.

🌐 From now on, the ORBS approval transaction will be required only when staking ORBS for the first time, after which it will no longer be needed when re-staking.
