Every application running on Orbs typically runs on its own virtual chain. Virtualization
provides applications with an isolated environment while utilizing a shared physical
infrastructure of nodes. Each virtual chain maintains its own separate chain of blocks,
state, and runs its own concurrent instance of consensus.
All Orbs validators run all virtual chains in parallel, making the permissionless pool of
validators completely shared and staked across the full network. This provides
applications with the security and decentralization of the entire network while
maintaining a strong degree of independence.

Consensus on transactions of different virtual chains can be run independently and are
run concurrently on separate resources. The ledgers of virtual chains can
also be
maintained independently and their compute can be performed in parallel. Moreover,
the isolation of state for each virtual chain reduces the memory requirements of the networkâ€™s virtual machine.

#### More on Virtual Chains

Virtual chains provide the feel and benefit of a dedicated blockchain while running on top of a shared physical node infrastructure, enjoying the security and decentralization provided by the shared environment as well as the isolation and customization provided by virtualization.
