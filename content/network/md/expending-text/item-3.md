The Orbs project includes a full blockchain stack designed and implemented from scratch by the core team, and is not a fork
of any existing solution. The project is active on open source with about 150 repositories publicly available on Github.
The codebase provides an end-to-end developer experience with everything needed to create and execute blockchain
applications including:

- Microservice implementation of the node core
- Consensus algorithm
- Smart contract SDKs for building backends in multiple languages
- Local development server (Gamma)
- Block explorer (Prism)
- Client SDKs for building web and mobile frontends in multiple languages, and more
