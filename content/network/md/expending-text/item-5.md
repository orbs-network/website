Orbs smart contracts provide seamless cross-chain access to Ethereum state under consensus, thus allowing applications to read the Ethereum state directly using the above mechanism. This allows applications running on Orbs to leverage the power of Ethereum directly without leaving the platform. An example of this technology is autonomous swap, a secure mechanism that allows developers to move part of the base-layer assets (ex: ERC-20 tokens) to run on Orbs for their utility while keeping other parts on the base-layer for trade.

##### Advantages

- Avoid painful token migrations when moving between blockchains
- Developers can use their base-layer’s token ecosystem (wallets and exchanges)
- Tokens can be kept on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) base-layer for added security without the performance and cost drawbacks
- Take advantage of the liquidity of the base-layer while using Orbs’ scalable production environment

#### More on Cross-chain Interoperability

As blockchain development becomes mainstream, platforms must offer a lower barrier to entry for blockchain developers to remain competitive.
