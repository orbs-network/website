Applications running on public blockchain are unique in their ability to facilitate trust by providing blockchain-backed guarantees to their users. Whereas many popular public blockchain solutions like Ethereum are designed primarily for purely decentralized applications (dapps), Orbs expands the offerings of public blockchains by also supporting permissioned applications developed by existing for-profit businesses. The Orbs project is currently focused primarily on DeFi applications, where Orbs’ independent consensus layer can be used to enrich DeFi contracts on EVM-based L1’s such as Ethereum - where most existing liquidity in DeFi resides. For example, consider an EVM-based DeFi vault where external Guardians act as oracles over EVM data and allow EVM contracts to make external decisions that are impossible to implement in the EVM alone.
