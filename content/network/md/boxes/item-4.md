##### SMART CONTRACTS IN ANY LANGUAGE

Every virtual chain is allocated separate computing, storage and consensus resources providing a guaranteed SLA to its users. Congestion in one virtual chain does not propagate to other virtual chains, making performance predictable and reliable. Resource isolation also prevents fee surges resulting from competition for network resources between applications and enables a predictable fee model absent from most shared-resources blockchains.
