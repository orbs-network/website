##### NON-DETERMINISTIC EXECUTION

Since execution engines of standard languages are not deterministic in nature (eg. heap addresses), dealing with non-determinism is a core requirement of the platform. Starting from fail-safe mechanisms in the consensus algorithm itself for failing transactions where consensus is impossible, to APIs defining acceptable thresholds for consensus when the results for each validator differ (while storing each validatorâ€™s result for future audit), the Orbs Network employs a variety of methods for solving these issues.
