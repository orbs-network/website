##### ISOLATION AND DEDICATED RESOURCES

Every virtual chain is allocated separate computing, storage and consensus resources providing a
guaranteed SLA to its users. _Congestion in one virtual chain_ does not propagate to other
virtual chains, making performance predictable and reliable. Resource isolation also
prevents fee surges **resulting from competition** for network resources between
applications and enables a predictable fee model absent from most [shared-resources](www.google.com) blockchains.
