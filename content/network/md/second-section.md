### Pain and Solution - 
### Removing Centralized Points of Failure

DeFi, Web 3.0 protocols and dApps are becoming more and more complex, while smart contracts are still inherently limited by design. This means that many DeFi and Web 3.0 projects still rely on centralized backend infrastructure, which is not ideal from security, liability and community perspectives.

The Orbs Network solves this pain by operating as a decentralized serverless cloud, allowing developers to extend smart contracts with L3 decentralized backend services. These are deployed to be executed by Orbs PoS validators (known as Guardians) and relieve projects of the need to rely on centralized backend solutions.
