    title: The winning blockchain stack
    text: Combining Orbs scalability, low fees and isolation between virtual chains with a first-grade developer experience, online IDE and smart contracts in familiar languages.    Developers get the perfect mix of performance, cost, security and ease of use.

    title: SERVERLESS CLOUD FOR APP DEVELOPERS
    text: The Orbs platform is a decentralized serverless cloud allowing developers to build backend services (applications) that are then deployed to be executed by Orbsvalidators. The main offerings of the platform include compute under consensus (execution of “smart contracts”) and storage under consensus. Applications running on publicblockchain are unique in their ability to facilitate trust by providing blockchain-backed guarantees to their users. Whereas many popular public blockchain solutions likeEthereum are designed primarily for purely decentralized applications (dapps), Orbs expands the offerings of public blockchains by also supporting permissioned applicationsdeveloped by existing for-profit businesses.

    title: COMPLETE BLOCKCHAIN STACK
    text: The Orbs project includes a full blockchain stack designed and implemented from scratch by the core team, and is not a fork of any existing solution. The project isactive on open source with about 150 repositories publicly available on Github. The codebase provides an end-to-end developer experience with everything needed to create andexecute blockchain applications including
