## Layer 3

#### The missing piece in the blockchain stack

The first infrastructure layer, L1 (like Ethereum), is in charge of security.
The second infrastructure layer, L2 (like Polygon), is in charge of scalability.

The third infrastructure layer, L3, is in charge of executing complex logic and scripts that cannot be
implemented on smart contracts alone. This layer provides services to existing DeFi applications for further
decentralization and enhanced capabilities.
