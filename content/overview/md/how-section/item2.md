#### Competitive Pricing and Lower Fees

By utilizing Liquidity Hub, Orbs allows DEXs to provide their users with access to aggregated liquidity from multiple sources, ensuring more competitive pricing on swaps. This means users can achieve better prices and lower fees compared to traditional decentralized exchanges that may suffer from liquidity fragmentation. Additionally, the Perpetual Hub offers more capital-efficient perpetual trading, translating to better pricing and reduced costs for users engaging in perpetual futures trading.
