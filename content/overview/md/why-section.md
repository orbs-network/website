### Why?

Orbs mission is to revolutionize on-chain trading by delivering CeFi-level pricing and execution capabilities to the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

### How?

This is achieved by leveraging Orbs innovative Layer-3 blockchain infrastructure, which enhances existing Layer-1 and Layer-2 solutions and enables complex logic to be implemented on a fully decentralized stack without moving liquidity to a new chain. Utilizing proof-of-stake consensus, Orbs acts as a decentralized backend that powers unique protocols such as dLIMIT, dTWAP, Liquidity Hub, and Perpetual Hub. These, in turn, optimize trading with aggregated liquidity, advanced trading orders, and on-chain derivatives, which push the boundaries of DeFi and on-chain trading.

### What?

Orbs provides a robust Layer-3 blockchain infrastructure designed specifically to bring advanced CeFi-level execution to on-chain trading.
