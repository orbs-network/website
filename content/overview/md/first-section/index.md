### What is Orbs?

Orbs is a decentralized Layer-3 (L3) blockchain infrastructure designed specifically for advanced on-chain trading. Orbs improves on-chain trading by providing technology for aggregated liquidity, advanced trading orders, and decentralized derivatives.

This is made possible by Orbs enhancing the capabilities of both EVM and non-EVM smart contracts without moving liquidity onto a new chain. This unique setup creates a decentralized backend that brings CeFi-level execution to DeFi trading.
