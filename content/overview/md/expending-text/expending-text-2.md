The Orbs platform is a decentralized serverless cloud allowing developers to build backend services (applications) that are then deployed to be executed by Orbs validators. The main offerings of the platform include compute under consensus (execution of “smart contracts”) and storage under consensus. Applications running on public blockchain are unique in their ability to facilitate trust by providing blockchain-backed guarantees to their users. Whereas many popular public blockchain solutions like Ethereum are designed primarily for purely decentralized applications (dapps), Orbs expands the offerings of public blockchains by also supporting permissioned applications developed by existing for-profit businesses.
