##### INDEPENDENT APP GOVERNANCE

Isolation between virtual chains allows each app to make its own protocol governance decisions, such as fixing a vulnerability in a deployed smart contract or customizing a protocol parameter like its consensus block rate. This provides applications with the stability lacking in shared infrastructure solutions and reduces protocol forks as interests are less likely to conflict. Applications are also no longer at risk of having their block history reverted due to a network-wide decision such as The DAO fork or prevented from deploying a fix like with the Parity bug.
