##### SMART CONTRACTS IN ANY LANGUAGE

Orbs pioneers the paradigm of smart contracts as a library in any language, like Go and JavaScript, instead of dedicated languages like Solidity. This flexibility allows existing teams to transition to blockchain development and existing tools and libraries to be reused. Smart contracts are deployed on-chain as source code, making them easier to read and thus safer, and compiled locally on-demand by validators. Implementation challenges include efficient sandboxing and dealing with non deterministic outputs that cannot undergo consensus.
