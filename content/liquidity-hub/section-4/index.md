title: Mitigating Centralization risks using Orbs L3
---


All on-chain parts are trustless since contracts verify all actions. However, users may be concerned that Liquidity Hub backend is able to manipulate trades in some way. This concern is mitigated  by using the Orbs Network’s decentralized L3 technology.

As part of Liquidity Hub, Orbs Guardians will run software utilizing [ORBS-VM](https://docs.orbs.network/v3/orbs-vm/what-is-orbs-vm), which acts as a decentralized backend that is required for Liquidity Hub’s to run optimally and in a fully decentralized manner. 

The Orbs Network has dozens of independent validators running Proof-of-Stake consensus with over $100 million staked. The network has been running in mainnet since 2019.

The Liquidity Hub is a beta version that is still under active development.
