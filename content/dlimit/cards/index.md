title: A limit order enables users to buy or sell tokens at a specified price or better.

---




Decentralized limit orders are not trivial to implement using smart contracts. Flawed implementation of limit orders in DeFi can hurt users by executing the order at a price much worse than they intended, or the order not being executed at all.

The dLIMIT smart contract for DEXs ensures that limit orders are executed at an optimal price and at fair fees, in a decentralized and reliable manner.
