Guardians are responsible for operating the validator nodes, maintaining the security of the network and upholding its long term vision. As such, Guardians are required to gain the trust of both the Delegators and the developers that rely on the network with their applications. In order to ensure a secure, available and performant network, Guardians are required to have a commitment to an honest and secure operation of the network.

Guardians are also expected to be committed to their communities and their Delegators’ staked tokens. Therefore, Guardians are required to own a personal stake of at least 8% of their total delegated stake. This requirement guarantees a higher level of commitment.

A high commitment of the ones operating the validator nodes is most important for adoption by applications and is required by scalable applications. ORBS token, staking, delegation and voting already operate over Ethereum contracts, utilizing Ethereum’s value as an objective auditor, thus the Orbs platform’s architecture runs the core of the election logic on Ethereum.

The entire election logic, reward calculation and distribution are carried out using Ethereum contracts providing multiple advantages.
