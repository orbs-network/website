##### Economic Incentives

  to their stake
- Annual reward is up to 8% of the Delegator’s staked tokens (subject to an 80M ORBS Token cap on total rewards). [Find out more about the Orbs reward system.](http://www.google.com "link")
- Only delegation to an active Guardian that participates in the elected committee receives rewards. Also, it is important to note that staking rewards may vary between Guardians, so choose your Guardian carefully!
