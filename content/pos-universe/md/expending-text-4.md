Orbs’ architecture deploys a hybrid model of two committees: General and Certified. This innovative two-committee approach is introduced to address developers’ needs and reduce their barrier of entry, while maintaining an open and permissionless PoS ecosystem.

The first and main committee is the General committee. It comprises the top 22 Guardians with the most delegated stake, whether they have been certified or not. The General committee represents the vast majority of ORBS stake and therefore provides a high quality operation suitable for most applications.
