Orbs’ architecture deploys a hybrid model of two committees: General and Certified.

This innovative two-committee approach is introduced to address developers’ needs and reduce their barrier of entry, while maintaining an open and permissionless PoS ecosystem.

The first and main committee is the General committee. It comprises the top 22 Guardians with the most delegated stake, whether they have been certified or not. The General committee represents the vast majority of ORBS stake and therefore provides a high quality operation suitable for most applications.

In contrast, the Certified committee includes only Guardians who meet certain requirements and have undergone a certification process that includes providing certain identification information. The Certified committee provides a suitable solution for developers with regulatory restrictions that are interested in running applications on a blockchain. Developers may also choose initially to use the Certified committee to reduce friction and transition to the General committee over time.
