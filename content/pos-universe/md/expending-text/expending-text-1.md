In Year 0 of the project, the separation of Validators and Guardians provided applications with the ability to run their business applications on the network prior to full stabilization of the network ecosystem. Direct communication with the Validators, along with a mandatory minimal technical due-diligence process, enabled a stable network for applications, while the permissionless Guardian role allowed the PoS ecosystem to flourish.

Orbs Guardians represent the Orbs community; they maintain the security of the network and they invest time and efforts in the network success. As the most significant stakeholders in the network, they are most suitable to provide applications developers the required security and availability.

The Orbs Universe provides community members that are not constantly active an opportunity to contribute to the network by delegating their stake to Guardians. Therefore, when a Guardian operates a validator node and signs a block, it is backed not just by the Guardianâ€™s own stake, but also by the stake delegated to him. The delegated stake significantly increases the amount of stake that backs the network security and therefore increases applications' trust in its operation. Moreover, the delegated stake plays an important role in preventing network attacks. An attacker that wishes to gain control of the network for a short period of time and act maliciously will need to possess more stake than the current network Guardians and their community in order to be elected.
