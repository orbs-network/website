The Orbs incentive layer is built to incentivize a maximum overlap between the two committees.

A high overlap implies a higher stake backing each committee. Guardians are incentivized to meet the certification requirements and earn additional rewards associated with participation in the certified committee.

Certified Guardians are incentivized to accumulate a high stake to enjoy the rewards of the General committee.
