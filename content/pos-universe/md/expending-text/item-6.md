Orbs PoS Universe significantly reduces the cost of operating and maintaining a validator node on the Orbs Network. This, combined with the development of new automation tools for Guardians, will decrease the operation costs of existing Guardians, as well as lower the barrier to entry of new Guardians into the Orbs Universe, thereby improving the level of the Orbs networkâ€™s decentralization.

Below is a list of the the key improvements in terms of efficiency and cost reduction:

- Operation cost is significantly reduced
- For AWS-deployed nodes: a base infrastructure monthly cost reduction, with options to reduce the cost further by reserving resources in advance.
- An elastic architecture that leverages cloud architectures and enables compute and storage resources allocation as needed for the network use.
- Transition to EFS/NFS-based block storage architecture, significantly reducing the storage cost and providing more flexible resource sharing among Virtual Chains, while maintaining the Virtual Chains isolation.
- Utilizing light Ethereum client architecture to reduce the cost of the Ethereum service operation.
- Automatic and simple node setup, with enhanced logging and monitoring tools for reduced operations overhead.
