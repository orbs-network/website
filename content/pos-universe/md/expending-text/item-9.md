The Orbs Network launched in March of 2019​. The successful mainnet launch has enabled the growth of the Orbs ecosystem across all vectors. During Year 0 of the mainnet, development efforts were focused on building and maintaining a secure, stable and inclusive network. While at first the goal was mostly network stability, with time it evolved into growth and scalability.

Orbs Network emphasizes usage and performance while empowering the Orbs Universe Guardians. It enables Orbs Universe Guardians to take an active role in building and maintaining a secure, scalable network, which will be the first choice for blockchain adoption, and to better manage and serve the network and its participants.

With the launch of V2.5, Orbs introduced numerous improvements, mainly in the staking rewards assignment and distribution architecture, leading to an improved distribution mechanism and significant reduction in Guardians operating costs. Orbs team aims to enhance network security and scalability through the Orbs PoS Universe and enables the on-boarding of clients with different use-cases.

##### Below are some of the main key features of Orbs PoS Universe:

- Operating the Network validator nodes by Guardians
- Guardians’ Ownership Over Reward Distributions
- PoS on Ethereum
- Election Committees
- Rewards, Fees & Bootstrap Fund
- Validator Nodes Streamlining
