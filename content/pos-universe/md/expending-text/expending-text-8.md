Delegators are ORBS token holders who assign their voting weight (stake) to Guardians, thereby empowering them to maintain security of the Network and uphold the long term vision of the ecosystem.

Therefore, it is the role of the Orbs delegators to actively contribute to the network’s success by staking their ORBS tokens. Orbs ​Locking Mechanism​ enhances the stability and security of the Orbs Network.

In addition, the Orbs team developed TETRA​, a dedicated staking wallet, from which any ORBS holder can easily stake tokens with a Guardian of their choice. Both improvements were widely adopted by the Orbs community.
