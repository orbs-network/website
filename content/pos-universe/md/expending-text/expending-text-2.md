The Guardians are the key players responsible for network security and operation. Guardians are expected to build a community of Delegators that trust them to truthfully represent their and the networkâ€™s interests.

Providing the Guardians with the ability to set the level of rewards that will be distributed to their respective Delegators tightens their relationships with their communities. Staking rewards are set by the Guardians, who determine how to split the rewards amongst their Delegators, while a minimum rate of compensation to Guardians is imposed by the protocol.
