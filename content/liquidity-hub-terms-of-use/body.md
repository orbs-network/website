##  LIQUIDITY HUB SOFTWARE PROTOCOL AND SMART CONTRACT TERMS OF USE 

These Terms of Use ("Terms") are a multi-party contract among you and all other participants in the current  and future decentralized, blockchain-based protocol and other supporting software for providing a liquidity  optimization layer for decentralized exchanges (the "Protocol"), initially developed by Orbs Ltd. ("Orbs").  When the Protocol is adopted and implemented by any exchange or trading platform (each, an "Exchange"),  this software allows an Exchange to seek external sources of liquidity for its traders prior to executing such  trades on the Exchange's core Automated Market Maker trading pools (collectively, the "Services"). These  Terms apply to all participants in the Protocol, including: (i) any Exchange which elects to integrate the  Protocol or to otherwise utilize the Protocol to provide the Services; (ii) the individuals and entities that are  the end-users of such applications or that otherwise interact directly or indirectly with the Protocol ("Users"); (iii) those participants interacting with the Protocol by providing bids in order to fill orders and  execute transactions on the Protocol (each, a "Solver"), which Solvers may include participants providing  such services through smart contracts constituting a portion of the Protocol or another similar decentralized  blockchain program, as well as centralized Exchanges acting on their own account, traders on centralized  Exchanges, market makers, or other third parties who access the Protocol via an API; (iv) the validator  nodes ("Guardians") who operate that certain decentralized blockchain infrastructure developed by Orbs  (the "Orbs Network"), which now or in the future may provide certain functionality to the Protocol,  including by executing software that governs the ability of certain Solvers to interact and execute trades  using the Protocol, selects which bids are ultimately executed by the Protocol and/or causes the execution  of such trades on the applicable underlying blockchain; and (v) Orbs and any and all entities and persons  affiliated with Orbs, including their respective current or future subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers,  employees, agents, representatives, and any other person or entity with any involvement in developing the  Protocol ((i)-(v), collectively, the "Subject Persons"). Individually and collectively, each Subject Person  will be referred to as "you" or "your." Your use of and access to the Protocol and any Services or  applications available through the Protocol, any financial transactions and any information, text, photos,  graphics, videos, idea, concept, discovery, invention, development, technology, algorithm, program, code,  documentation or other material or information available on or through the Protocol is subject to these  Terms. 

These Terms are a legal agreement, and they contain important information on your legal rights, remedies  and obligations. You may use the Protocol only if you can form a binding contract. 

Please read and review these Terms carefully.  

The Protocol is available only to individuals who (a) are at least eighteen (18) years old; and (b) possess  the legal capacity to enter into these Terms (on behalf of themselves and their organization) and to form a  binding agreement under any applicable law. You hereby represent that you possess the legal authority to  enter into these Terms on your and your organization's behalf and to form a binding agreement under any  applicable law, to use the Protocol in accordance with these Terms, and to perform fully your obligations  hereunder. 

##### 1\. Overview of the Protocol

The Protocol is a smart contract-based protocol that allows Users to receive the Services by creating orders on an Exchange for trades in digital assets, on which Solvers may provide bids with proposed terms for  execution of such orders. Utilizing smart contracts on the applicable underlying blockchain and software  executed by the Orbs Guardians, the Protocol determines whether a bid submitted by any Solver meets any  applicable parameters set by the User, the applicable Exchange or the Protocol, and, in the event that one  or more bid meets such parameters , will select a winning bid and present it to the User. If the User accepts,  the Protocol will cause such trade to be executed directly on the underlying blockchain. In the event that no 

bid from a Solver meets the applicable parameters, or the proposed trade is rejected by the User, the order  will be processed under the standard procedures, terms and conditions of the applicable Exchange. 

You hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that the Protocol is a decentralized software application for  which no Subject Person: (A) is responsible for its operation or (B) undertakes any responsibility to operate,  maintain, support or otherwise authorize any related activity. 


THE PROTOCOL HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, AND TO THE  EXTENT LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE, ORBS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR  LOSS INCURRED TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON AS A RESULT OF OR IN CONNECTION  WITH YOUR USE OF THE PROTOCOL.  

YOUR USE OF THE PROTOCOL IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Fees. Certain fees may apply to utilizing the Protocol, which may be imposed by various parties. Such fees  may include (i) Solvers may set fees in their bids, which will be payable by Users in the event that such  bids are accepted; (ii) network fees (including, without limitation "miner's fees") required to use an  Exchange or an underlying blockchain may apply to a transaction, which a third party wallet application  may attempt to calculate, though it may not be sufficient or it may be excessive and you may select a greater  or lesser fee; and (iii) the applicable Exchange may charge Users or Solvers fees in accordance with the  applicable terms and conditions of such Exchange. You are solely responsible for selecting and paying any  and all the above-described different categories of fees. 

Be safe & secure: If you elect to utilize the Protocol, it is highly recommend that you educate yourself  regarding blockchain industry standard recommendations on how to be proactive about your security.  

Subject Persons are not responsible for any loss: The Protocol, the Exchanges, the Orbs Network, the assets  traded thereon, any underlying blockchain network, and any third party wallet software (such as Metamask) that may be used by you, are all still under active development and may (a) contain bugs, errors and defects,  (b) function improperly or be subject to periods of downtime and unavailability, (c) result in total or partial  loss or corruption of data and (d) be modified at any time, including through the release of subsequent  versions, all with or without notice to you. While the Protocol has been tested, there is always the possibility  something happens that causes your assets to be lost. Please do not transact more than you are willing to  lose, and please be careful. 

Non-Custodial Protocol: You do not create an account or give the Protocol your funds to hold. No data  leaves your computer / your browser. At no point will the Protocol ever take custody of User or Solver digital assets, which, if a trade is executed, will move directly from the User wallet to the Exchange on  which the trades are executed or to the Solver which fills such User order, and vice versa. The Protocol makes it easy for Users to create and execute multiple orders and sophisticated strategies on one or more  Exchanges. You acknowledge that neither the Protocol nor any Subject Person is responsible for  transferring, safeguarding, or maintaining your private keys or any digital assets associated therewith. If  you lose, mishandle or have stolen associated digital currency private keys, you acknowledge that you may  not be able to recover associated digital currency, and that no Subject Person is responsible for such loss or  for any loss, damage or liability arising from your failure to comply with the terms hereunder. 

Public Nature of Transactions: Transactions that take place utilizing the Protocol are managed and  ultimately confirmed via an underlying blockchain. You understand that your public address and the details  of any order you create and any transactions executed on your behalf will be made publicly visible whenever  you utilize the Protocol. 

Your responsibility for Transactions: You acknowledge that entering into any transaction electronically 


(including without limitation all records relating to such transactions) constitutes your agreement and intent  to be bound by and to pay for such agreements and transactions. Such transactions may, among other things,  include payments between participants for their activities on the network, fees paid to an Exchange or  Solvers for executing your orders, fees paid to Exchanges on which your transactions are executed and  amounts paid by you in exchange for other digital assets as part of such transactions. Notwithstanding that  such transactions and other similar transactions may be allowed, facilitated or encouraged by the design of  the Protocol, you acknowledge and agree that the actual entry into any such agreement, transaction or  arrangement utilizing the Protocol is accomplished either as a trade on the applicable Exchange, in  accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to such Exchange, or as a peer-to-peer transaction  between the parties thereto and is subject to the terms of the agreement between such parties, as applicable.  You are solely responsible for any disputes you may have with any counterparty or any other party  regarding such agreements and transactions. SUBJECT PERSONS DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY  RELATED TO ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN, BY AND AMONG YOU AND ANY USERS, SOLVERS,  EXCHANGE, ORBS GUARDIANS OR TRANSACTION COUNTERPARTY. 

Dependence on Third Party Applications: The Protocol includes smart contracts launched on one or more  underlying blockchain networks that takes orders for transactions that are executed by or with the assistance  of Solvers. All underlying blockchain networks, wallet software, Solvers and Exchanges are third parties  or third party applications, as the case may be. No Subject Person owns or controls these or any other third 

party site, product or service that you may choose to access, visit or use in the course or for the purpose of  interacting with the Protocol. Accordingly, by using the Protocol, you acknowledge and agree that no  Subject Person has control over, or any duty to take any action regarding any activities of such third parties.  No Subject Person makes any warranties or representations, express or implied, about any linked third party  application, its ownership or operation, the information contained on such application or the suitability of  such products or services. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your  use of any third-party website, applications, or resources. 

Risk Disclosures Regarding the Protocol: By utilizing the Service or interacting with the Protocol in any  way, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic and blockchain  systems; and warrant that you have an understanding of the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens,  blockchain-based software systems and decentralized finance platforms such as the Exchanges, including,  but not limited to, the following risks:  

A. In order to be completed, any transaction created with the Protocol must be confirmed and recorded  on the applicable underlying blockchain. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks  operated by independent third parties, which are not owned, controlled or operated by any Subject  Person. 

B. No Subject Person controls the actions of nodes on the underlying blockchains, any Solver, or the  Exchanges, and therefore cannot and do not ensure that any transactions you engage in via the  Protocol will be confirmed or confirmed correctly on the relevant networks. The transaction details  you submit via the Protocol may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the  applicable networks used to process the transaction. No Subject Person guarantees that the Protocol 

can transfer title or right in any digital assets or makes any warranties whatsoever with regard to  title. 

C. Once transaction details have been submitted via the Protocol, no Subject Person can assist you to  cancel or otherwise modify your transaction or transaction details. 

D. The Protocol has been designed such that all transactions are either verifiable on-chain or utilize  decentralized technology in order to prevent price manipulation. However, these features are in  beta and may contain bugs, errors and defects or be subject to periods of downtime and unacaia


E. If you are using a user interface to interact with the Protocol, such user interface may display  estimated information such as current market price, output tokens to be received in an order or other  information with respect to your entered transactions. All such information displayed on a user  interface may be inaccurate and such user interfaces may contain errors or defects.  

F. Use of the Protocol, in particular for trading digital assets, may carry financial risk. Digital assets  are, by their nature, highly experimental, risky, and volatile. Transactions entered into in connection  with the Protocol are irreversible, final and there are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that  you will access and use the Protocol and the Services at your own risk. The risk of loss in trading  digital assets can be substantial. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is  suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. By using the Protocol, you  represent and warrant that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your  independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given transaction and the underlying  digital assets. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication,  professional advice, and experience to make your evaluation of the merits and risks of any  transaction conducted in connection with the Protocol or any digital asset. You accept all  consequences of using the Protocol, including the risk that you may lose access to your digital  assets indefinitely. All transaction decisions are made solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in  these Agreement, no Subject Person accepts any responsibility whatsoever for, and will in no  circumstances be liable to you in connection with, your use of the Protocol for performing digital  asset transactions. 

G. No financial regulatory authority has reviewed or approved the use of the Orbs-developed software.  Use of the Protocol does not constitute advice or a recommendation concerning any commodity,  security, or other digital asset or instrument. Orbs is not acting as an investment adviser or  commodity trading adviser to any person or entity. 

##### 2\. Prohibited Conduct

##### 4\. Third Party Open Source Software and Third Party Services

- Portions of the Protocol may include third party open source software that are subject to third party  terms and conditions ("Third Party Terms"). If there is a conflict between any Third Party Terms  and the terms of this Agreement, then the Third Party Terms shall prevail but solely in connection  with the related third party open source software. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to  the contrary, Orbs makes no warranty or indemnity hereunder with respect to any third party open  source software. 

- When you use the Protocol, you may also be using the services of one or more third parties. Your  use of those and other third-party services ("Third-Party Services") will be subject to the privacy  policies, terms of use and similar policies and terms, and fees of those third party services. 

- The Protocol may contain links to Third-Party Service, and may leverage or plug into such Third  Party Services to enable certain features. When using a Third Party Service, you understand that  you are at no time transferring your assets to us.

No Subject Person makes any warranties or representations, express or  implied, about such linked Third Party Services, the third parties they are owned and operated by,  the information contained on them or the suitability of their products or services. You acknowledge  sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any third-party website,  applications, or resources. 

##### 5\. Representations and Warranties and Warranty Disclaimers 

The Protocol is deployed on peer-to-peer platforms with a decentralized, blockchain-based architecture  designed to provide the Services. As a decentralized protocol, the actual performance of the Protocol is  dependent on the collective actions of various participants in the Protocol, including Exchanges, Solvers  and Orbs Guardians. No party, including any Subject Person, can exert full control over the operation of  the Protocol or the actual results obtained from its use. You acknowledge and agree that the control of the  Protocol is distributed and that accordingly no particular party, including any Subject Person, is able to  provide warranties or guarantees regarding the future operations or actual results of any utilizing on the  Protocol.  

No Subject Person guarantees the accuracy, timeliness, correctness, completeness, performance or fitness  for a particular purpose of the Protocol. No Subject Person is liable for any errors, omissions, or  inaccuracies. Furthermore, the Subject Persons disclaim: (a) any and all responsibility or liability for the  accuracy, content, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability or operability of information or 


materials displayed on any user interface used to interact with the Protocol; (b) any and all responsibility  for the conduct of any user of the Services; (c) any and all responsibility for any harm resulting from  utilizing the Protocol; (d) any and all responsibility for any financial gains, losses or tax consequences  associated with the your use of the Services through the Protocol. 

WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THE TERMS, THE  PROTOCOL AND THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY  KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF  MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT 

AND THOSE ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. IN NO EVENT  SHALL ANY SUBJECT PERSON BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER  LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,  OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROTOCOL SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER  DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE. 

NO PARTY WARRANTS THAT THE PROTOCOL OR THE SERVICES WILL BE TIMELY, SECURE,  UNINTERRUPTED, OR OPERATED FREE OF DELAYS IN TRANSMISSION, FAILURE IN  PERFORMANCE, COMPUTER VIRUSES, INACCURACIES, ERRORS, OR DEFECTS. YOU USE  THE PROTOCOL AT YOUR OWN RISK. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING  SUFFICIENT PROCEDURES AND VIRUS CHECKS (INCLUDING ANTI-VIRUS AND OTHER  SECURITY CHECKS) TO SATISFY YOUR PARTICULAR REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ACCURACY  AND SECURITY OF DATA INPUT AND OUTPUT. THERE IS NO WARRANTY THAT THE  PROTOCOL WILL MEET USERS' OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS' REQUIREMENTS. NO ADVICE,  RESULTS OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH  THE PROTOCOL SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN. 

Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimers may not  apply to you. 

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR SOLE REMEDY FOR ANY PROBLEMS OR  DISSATISFACTION WITH THE PROTOCOL IS TO DISCONTINUE ALL USE OF THE PROTOCOL. 

##### 6\. Limitation of Liability 

EXCEPT AS SET FORTH HEREIN, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT  LIMITATION, BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR ARISING  UNDER ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, WILL ANY SUBJECT PERSON BE  LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DIRECT,  INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT ARISE  OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE PROTOCOL OR THE SERVICES OR FROM 

THE DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROTOCOL, OR FOR ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES  OBTAINED OR TRANSACTIONS EXECUTED THROUGH THE PROTOCOL, OR FROM THE  FAILURE OF THE PROTOCOL TO PERFORM AS DESCRIBED OR EXPECTED, OR FROM THE  FAILURE OF ANY SUBJECT PERSON TO PERFORM UNDER THESE TERMS OR OTHERWISE  ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE PROTOCOL, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF  SUCH DAMAGES. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THOSE  ASPECTS OF THE HEREIN LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, IN WHICH CASE  LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF THE SUBJECT PERSONS TO YOU FOR ALL  DAMAGES, LOSSES AND CAUSES OF ACTION EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE, ONE HUNDRED 

U.S. DOLLARS (US$100). 

##### 7\. Taxes 

You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for all tax consequences of any transaction or  activity you undertake using the Protocol, any provision or receipt of the Services, and/or any value received  in connection therewith. You are solely responsible for determining whether or not to use the Protocol or  to receive or provide any Services and you acknowledge that the Services may be subject to export  restrictions and economic sanctions imposed by law. To the extent that any Subject Person is a party to any  transaction utilizing the Protocol, you acknowledge and agree that such Subject Person may withhold any  tax or other amounts required by applicable law from any payment or consideration payable as a result of  such transaction. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Subject Person from any taxes imposed  as a result of your activities on the Protocol, any loss, liability or cost which such Subject Person determines  will or has been incurred as a result of any taxes resulting from your activities using the Protocol, or any  proceeding brought against a Subject Person by any governmental authority in connection with any taxes  resulting from your activities on the Protocol. 

##### 8\. Updates and Upgrades 

One or more Subject Person may from time to time provide updates or upgrades to the Protocol (each a  "Revision"), but are not under any obligation to do so. Such Revisions will be supplied according to the then-current policies governing the Protocol, which may include automatic updating or upgrading without  any additional notice to you. You hereby consent to any such automatic updating or upgrading of the  Protocol. All references herein to the Protocol shall include Revisions. This Agreement shall govern any  Revisions that replace or supplement the original Protocol, unless the Revision is accompanied by a separate  license agreement which will govern the Revision and/or if otherwise instructed in writing by a Subject  Person. 

##### 9\. Privacy 

If you use the Protocol for its intended functionality and engage in transactions, such actions and certain  information related thereto will be recorded on the applicable underlying blockchain network on which  such transaction or action is carried out, and, accordingly, information with respect to such transactions or  actions will be publicly visible and may be freely collected and analyzed by any person or entity for any  purpose. Many block chains are open to forensic analysis which can lead to deanonymization and the  unintentional revelation of private financial information, especially when block chain data is combined with  other data. Because these blockchains are decentralized or third-party networks that are not controlled or  operated by any Subject Person, no Subject Person will be able to erase, modify, or alter any of your  information from such networks. Please also be aware that certain information provided by you in  connection with your use of the Protocol may be stored on your device (even if no Subject Person collects that information). You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your device from unauthorized  access. 

##### 10\. Export Laws 

You agree to comply fully with all applicable export laws and regulations to ensure that neither the Protocol nor any technical data related thereto are exported or re-exported directly or indirectly in violation of, or  used for any purposes prohibited by, such laws and regulations.  

##### 11\. Term and Termination 

Your obligations and undertakings under this Agreement are effective until terminated by Orbs or by you. 


If you object to any term or condition of this Agreement or any subsequent modifications thereto, or become  dissatisfied with the Protocol in any way, your only recourse and remedy (and the sole liability and/or  obligation of any Subject Person) is to terminate your participation in this Agreement and discontinue  immediately use of the Protocol and the Service. 

Upon any termination of your participation under this Agreement, you shall cease all use of the Protocol.  Sections 3 (Intellectual Property Rights), **Error! Reference source not found.** (Open Source Software), 5  (Warranty Disclaimers), 6 (Limitation of Liability), 8 (Taxes), 9 (Privacy), and **Error! Reference source  not found.** (Assignment) to **Error! Reference source not found** .15 (General) shall survive termination of  this Agreement.  

##### 12\. Assignment 

Your agreement to these Terms is personal to you and you may not transfer or assign it to any third party.

##### 13\. Entire Agreement 

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, UNDERSTAND IT, AND  AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS. 

These Terms constitute the entire agreement among the Protocol participants and supersede all prior or  contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between you and  other Protocol participants, with respect to your use of the Protocol and all matters relating to your access  to, and/or use of, the Protocol and the Services. A printed version of these Terms and of any notice given  in electronic form shall be admissible in any and all judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or  relating to these Terms to the same extent as other business documents and records originally generated  and maintained in printed form. 

##### 14\. .Governing Law & Disputes 

Any dispute to which a Subject Person is a party arising out of or related to the Protocol will be brought in,  and you hereby consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue of, the competent courts of the Tel-Aviv-Jaffa  District, Israel, provided, however, that nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude a Subject Person from  bringing any suit, enforcing any right or taking other legal action in your local jurisdiction. You agree to  waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non-convenience and agree that process may  be served in a manner authorized by applicable law or court rule. 

##### 15\. General 

If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law including,  without limitation, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations stated herein, then the invalid or  unenforceable provision(s) will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remainder of these Terms shall continue in full effect. 

As part of these Terms, all Exchanges and any other participant who facilitates the use of the Protocol,  directly or indirectly, by any User, shall undertake to ensure that such User enters into an agreement or  other arrangement which governs the relationship between such participant and such User regarding the  Protocol and obligates such User to be subject to these Terms. Such Exchange or other participant is solely  responsible for the effectiveness of such arrangement with the applicable Users.
