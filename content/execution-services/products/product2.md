### Orbs VM - Decentralized Docker-Based Virtual Machine

**Dedicated decentralized virtual machine, similar in concept to AWS EC2 - but decentralized.**

Implement your custom service as a Docker container, without any blockchain specific knowledge. Use any programming language you like, such as Go, C++, Rust, JavaScript, Java, Python and more. Deploy your container to have it executed as an always-on service on dozens of independent decentralized validator nodes.
