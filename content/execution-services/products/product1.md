### Orbs Lambda - Decentralized Serverless Cloud Function

**Event driven, serverless and decentralized computing solution, similar in concept to AWS Lambda - but decentralized.**

Write your cloud function in regular JavaScript, without any blockchain specific knowledge. Code can utilize familiar node.js libraries such as node-fetch. Select a trigger for execution, like running on a new L1/L2 block or on a new L1/L2 on-chain event, and deploy. Your function will be executed on dozens of independent decentralized validator nodes.
