Current-generation blockchain protocols can determine their level of decentralization on an security-performance spectrum. A new family of consensus protocols enable the maximization of both security and throughput by employing novel cryptographic techniques for trustlessly generating random seeds in a group, without allowing any party to manipulate or predict the randomization results.
