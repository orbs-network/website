    - title: Orbs Grant Program
      date: Published August 2020
      description: Orbs is committed to advance the process of decentralization by involving even more developers and teams in the development of the Orbs ecosystem and is introducing the Orbs Ecosystem Grant Program (OEGP). We believe that the special features of the blockchain infrastructure of the Orbs Network and the incredibly strong and active community in the Orbs PoS Universe together provide a unique opportunity to interface and collaborate with DeFi

    - title: Bla of Ethereum as a Base Layer for PoS and PoA Platforms
      date: Published February 2019
      description: We designed Orbs for applications that make use of multiple blockchain platforms (i.e. a hybrid system) because we believe such design makes more sense for complex, real-world use cases. In this paper, we would like to highlight some of the advantages and challenges hybrid designs can bring to infrastructure projects.

    - title: "Blockchain Virtualization: A Necessity for Real-World DApps"
      date: Published August 2018
      description: In this paper we explore how virtualization solved significant barriers in web application backends, analyze the barriers experienced with current-generation blockchain technology, and explain how virtualization technology offers the potential to overcome these barriers.

    - title: "Eliminating the Security-vs-Scalability Dilemma: Randomized-Committee Consensus Protocols"
      date: Published August 2018
      description: Current-generation blockchain protocols can determine their level of decentralization on an security-performance spectrum. A new family of consensus protocols enable the maximization of both security and throughput by employing novel cryptographic techniques for trustlessly generating random seeds in a group, without allowing any party to manipulate or predict the randomization results.
