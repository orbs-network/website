The Orbs project is building on the TON Network (ton.org) and is working to provide L3 infrastructure services to TON dapps that can significantly increase their capabilities without relying on centralized infrastructure. In this third call for grants, Orbs is offering developer grants for building and integration work to Orbs core TON protocols. The grants are focused mostly around the TON ecosystem for FunC and TWA developers.
