The Orbs project is launching a new call for grants under the OEGP. For this round, the focus will be on applications that will draw on the power of the Orbs Universe, with its Guardians and Delegators, using their ability to arrive at consensus through the Orbs protocol incentive layer powered by the ORBS token.
