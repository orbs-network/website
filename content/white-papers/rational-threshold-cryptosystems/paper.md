We propose a framework for threshold cryptosystems under a permissionless-economic model in which the participants are rational profit-maximizing entities. The key threat to rational threshold cryptosystems is collusion—by cooperating `illegally’, a subset of participants can reveal the cryptosystem’s secret, which, in turn is translated to unfair profit. Our countermeasure to collusion is framing.
