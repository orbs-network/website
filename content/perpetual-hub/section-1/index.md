With Perpetual Hub, intent-based decentralized trading platforms will be able to use Orbs layer 3 technology to integrate one singular suite of necessary features without needing to build, pay, or otherwise integrate multiple partners for separate parts. 

Once Perpetual Hub is fully integrated into a perpetual trading platform, third-party market participants can utilize the technology to serve as Hedgers or Liquidators and utilize reliable decentralized price oracles.
