The Orbs project has recently joined forces with SYMMIO and IntentX to address the challenge of capital efficiency in on-chain derivatives trading and propel it to new heights.

While [SYMMIO](https://www.symm.io/) is the smart contract layer of intent-based perpetual futures trading and [IntentX runs](https://intentx.io/) the frontend UI, Orbs completes this powerful trio with Perpetual Hub -- a decentralized protocol for the necessary functions required for the intent-based engine to operate.
