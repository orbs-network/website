Through its novel Layer 3 technology, the Orbs Network enhances the capabilities of smart contract platforms, providing essential services to DEXs across DeFi.

Tools utilizing Orbs L3 technology include [Liquidity Hub](https://www.orbs.com/liquidity-hub/) for aggregated liquidity and lower price impact, as well as Advanced Trading Orders, such as decentralized [limit](https://www.orbs.com/dlimit/) and [TWAP](https://www.orbs.com/dtwap/) orders, for efficient execution. The release of Perpetual Hub establishes Orbs' technology as a key DeFi infrastructure for DEXs in spot and futures markets.

The Orbs Network has dozens of independent validators running Proof-of-Stake consensus, with over $100 million staked. It has been running on the mainnet since 2019.
