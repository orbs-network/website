##### WEB ORACLES AND OFF-CHAIN INTEROPERABILITY

The parallel and concurrent operation of different virtual chains results in virtual separation, as smart contracts are likely to interact mostly with smart contracts deployed on the same virtual chain. When a new virtual chain is created, Orbs validators dynamically allocate more resources for its execution (eg. instantiate a new AWS machine in the node cluster) allowing for a virtually limitless number of virtual chains to run on the network in parallel.
