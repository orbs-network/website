##### WEB ORACLES AND OFF-CHAIN INTEROPERABILITY

Providing non-determinism as a feature opens up new use cases for smart contracts such as accessing web oracles and off-chain data that isnâ€™t straightforward to access under consensus. The benefits are clear, as many real-world applications require the ability to interoperate with existing systems or databases that are not on-chain. Native support for direct query of external data by validator nodes makes reliance on dedicated oracle nodes, that often become the weak links in the system, obsolete.
