On a request to join the committee, the committee member checks that the candidate is qualified to join. If the candidateâ€™s weight is higher than the committee member with the lowest weight, the candidate will join the committee instead of the minimal weight Guardian.
Upon a change in the committee members list or their certification, the contact notifies the stakingRewards and FeesAndBootstrap contracts on the leaving and joining members to update their rewards state.
