The guardiansRegistration contract stores the guardians registration data. And allow guardians to register, modify their data and unregister. In addition the contact stores a metadata map allowing each guardian to store general purpose keys to be queried by the Orbs platform. For example, a link to the guardian identification data may be stored at the "ID_FORM_URL" metadata key.
