Delegators are ORBS token holders who assign their voting weight (stake) to Guardians, empowering them to maintain security and uphold the long term vision of the ecosystem.

##### Roles and Responsibilities

- Guardians operate the Orbs network nodes and run the virtual chains for the subscribed applications
- Guardians are responsible for the staking rewards distribution to their community of delegators
- Orbs is a hybrid blockchain, utilizing Ethereum for added security and transparency of the Orbs PoS ecosystem. Thus, Orbs Guardians are required to run an Ethereum node.
- Guardians have an option to be part of the Certified Committee and operate virtual chains that require certified Guardians. Certified Committee members are eligible for added incentives. Guardians are expected to be committed to their communities and their Delegators’ staked tokens. Therefore, Guardians are required to have a self-stake of at least 8% of their total delegated stake.

##### Economic Incentives

- Applications running virtual chains on Orbs pay fees directly to the Guardians, representing the cost of the computational resources allocated to the virtual chain.
- Guardians receive staking rewards of at least 4% of their delegated stake (subject to an 80M Orbs Token cap on total rewards), for operating the network and contributing to the network’s security.
- Guardians who choose to participate in the Certified Committee receive a bootstrap fund distributed in DAI
