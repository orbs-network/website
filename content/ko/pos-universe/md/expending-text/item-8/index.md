Delegators are ORBS token holders who assign their voting weight (stake) to Guardians, thereby empowering them to maintain security of the Network and uphold the long term vision of the ecosystem. Therefore, it is the role of the Orbs delegators to actively contribute to the networkâ€™s success by staking their ORBS tokens.
