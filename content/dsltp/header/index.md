# Stop-Loss & Take-Profit
# Protocol for AMM

dSLTP is a decentralized stop-loss and take-profit protocol for DEXs, enabling automated risk management directly on chain. Built on Orbs Layer 3, dSLTP is designed to execute orders reliably and transparently, without relying on bots, scripts, or centralized off chain infrastructure.
