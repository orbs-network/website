    >LIQUIDITY HUB SOFTWARE PROTOCOL AND SMART CONTRACT TERMS OF USE</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>These Terms of Use (&quot;Terms&quot;) are a multi-party contract among you and all other participants in the current  and future decentralized, blockchain-based protocol and other supporting software for providing a liquidity  optimization layer for decentralized exchanges (the &quot;Protocol&quot;), initially developed by Orbs Ltd. (&quot;Orbs&quot;).  When the Protocol is adopted and implemented by any exchange or trading platform (each, an &quot;Exchange&quot;),  this software allows an Exchange to seek external sources of liquidity for its traders prior to executing such  trades on the Exchange&#39;s core Automated Market Maker trading pools (collectively, the &quot;Services&quot;). These  Terms apply to all participants in the Protocol, including: (i) any Exchange which elects to integrate the  Protocol or to otherwise utilize the Protocol to provide the Services; (ii) the individuals and entities that are  the end-users of such applications or that otherwise interact directly or indirectly with the Protocol (&quot;Users&quot;); (iii) those participants interacting with the Protocol by providing bids in order to fill orders and  execute transactions on the Protocol (each, a &quot;Solver&quot;), which Solvers may include participants providing  such services through smart contracts constituting a portion of the Protocol or another similar decentralized  blockchain program, as well as centralized Exchanges acting on their own account, traders on centralized  Exchanges, market makers, or other third parties who access the Protocol via an API; (iv) the validator  nodes (&quot;Guardians&quot;) who operate that certain decentralized blockchain infrastructure developed by Orbs  (the &quot;Orbs Network&quot;), which now or in the future may provide certain functionality to the Protocol,  including by executing software that governs the ability of certain Solvers to interact and execute trades  using the Protocol, selects which bids are ultimately executed by the Protocol and/or causes the execution  of such trades on the applicable underlying blockchain; and (v) Orbs and any and all entities and persons  affiliated with Orbs, including their respective current or future subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers,  employees, agents, representatives, and any other person or entity with any involvement in developing the  Protocol ((i)-(v), collectively, the &quot;Subject Persons&quot;). Individually and collectively, each Subject Person  will be referred to as &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your.&quot; Your use of and access to the Protocol and any Services or  applications available through the Protocol, any financial transactions and any information, text, photos,  graphics, videos, idea, concept, discovery, invention, development, technology, algorithm, program, code,  documentation or other material or information available on or through the Protocol is subject to these  Terms. </p><p  class='text-p'>These Terms are a legal agreement, and they contain important information on your legal rights, remedies  and obligations. You may use the Protocol only if you can form a binding contract. </p><p  class='text-p'>Please read and review these Terms carefully.  </p><p  class='text-p'>The Protocol is available only to individuals who (a) are at least eighteen (18) years old; and (b) possess  the legal capacity to enter into these Terms (on behalf of themselves and their organization) and to form a  binding agreement under any applicable law. You hereby represent that you possess the legal authority to  enter into these Terms on your and your organization&#39;s behalf and to form a binding agreement under any  applicable law, to use the Protocol in accordance with these Terms, and to perform fully your obligations  hereunder. </p><h5 id="1-overview-of-the-protocol"  class='title-h5'
    >1. Overview of the Protocol</h5>
<p  class='text-p'>The Protocol is a smart contract-based protocol that allows Users to receive the Services by creating orders on an Exchange for trades in digital assets, on which Solvers may provide bids with proposed terms for  execution of such orders. Utilizing smart contracts on the applicable underlying blockchain and software  executed by the Orbs Guardians, the Protocol determines whether a bid submitted by any Solver meets any  applicable parameters set by the User, the applicable Exchange or the Protocol, and, in the event that one  or more bid meets such parameters , will select a winning bid and present it to the User. If the User accepts,  the Protocol will cause such trade to be executed directly on the underlying blockchain. In the event that no </p><p  class='text-p'>bid from a Solver meets the applicable parameters, or the proposed trade is rejected by the User, the order  will be processed under the standard procedures, terms and conditions of the applicable Exchange. </p><p  class='text-p'>You hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that the Protocol is a decentralized software application for  which no Subject Person: (A) is responsible for its operation or (B) undertakes any responsibility to operate,  maintain, support or otherwise authorize any related activity. </p><p  class='text-p'>THE PROTOCOL HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, AND TO THE  EXTENT LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE, ORBS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR  LOSS INCURRED TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON AS A RESULT OF OR IN CONNECTION  WITH YOUR USE OF THE PROTOCOL.  </p><p  class='text-p'>YOUR USE OF THE PROTOCOL IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p><p  class='text-p'>Fees. Certain fees may apply to utilizing the Protocol, which may be imposed by various parties. Such fees  may include (i) Solvers may set fees in their bids, which will be payable by Users in the event that such  bids are accepted; (ii) network fees (including, without limitation &quot;miner&#39;s fees&quot;) required to use an  Exchange or an underlying blockchain may apply to a transaction, which a third party wallet application  may attempt to calculate, though it may not be sufficient or it may be excessive and you may select a greater  or lesser fee; and (iii) the applicable Exchange may charge Users or Solvers fees in accordance with the  applicable terms and conditions of such Exchange. You are solely responsible for selecting and paying any  and all the above-described different categories of fees. </p><p  class='text-p'>Be safe &amp; secure: If you elect to utilize the Protocol, it is highly recommend that you educate yourself  regarding blockchain industry standard recommendations on how to be proactive about your security.  </p><p  class='text-p'>Subject Persons are not responsible for any loss: The Protocol, the Exchanges, the Orbs Network, the assets  traded thereon, any underlying blockchain network, and any third party wallet software (such as Metamask) that may be used by you, are all still under active development and may (a) contain bugs, errors and defects,  (b) function improperly or be subject to periods of downtime and unavailability, (c) result in total or partial  loss or corruption of data and (d) be modified at any time, including through the release of subsequent  versions, all with or without notice to you. While the Protocol has been tested, there is always the possibility  something happens that causes your assets to be lost. Please do not transact more than you are willing to  lose, and please be careful. </p><p  class='text-p'>Non-Custodial Protocol: You do not create an account or give the Protocol your funds to hold. No data  leaves your computer / your browser. At no point will the Protocol ever take custody of User or Solver digital assets, which, if a trade is executed, will move directly from the User wallet to the Exchange on  which the trades are executed or to the Solver which fills such User order, and vice versa. The Protocol makes it easy for Users to create and execute multiple orders and sophisticated strategies on one or more  Exchanges. You acknowledge that neither the Protocol nor any Subject Person is responsible for  transferring, safeguarding, or maintaining your private keys or any digital assets associated therewith. If  you lose, mishandle or have stolen associated digital currency private keys, you acknowledge that you may  not be able to recover associated digital currency, and that no Subject Person is responsible for such loss or  for any loss, damage or liability arising from your failure to comply with the terms hereunder. </p><p  class='text-p'>Public Nature of Transactions: Transactions that take place utilizing the Protocol are managed and  ultimately confirmed via an underlying blockchain. You understand that your public address and the details  of any order you create and any transactions executed on your behalf will be made publicly visible whenever  you utilize the Protocol. </p><p  class='text-p'>Your responsibility for Transactions: You acknowledge that entering into any transaction electronically </p><p  class='text-p'>(including without limitation all records relating to such transactions) constitutes your agreement and intent  to be bound by and to pay for such agreements and transactions. Such transactions may, among other things,  include payments between participants for their activities on the network, fees paid to an Exchange or  Solvers for executing your orders, fees paid to Exchanges on which your transactions are executed and  amounts paid by you in exchange for other digital assets as part of such transactions. Notwithstanding that  such transactions and other similar transactions may be allowed, facilitated or encouraged by the design of  the Protocol, you acknowledge and agree that the actual entry into any such agreement, transaction or  arrangement utilizing the Protocol is accomplished either as a trade on the applicable Exchange, in  accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to such Exchange, or as a peer-to-peer transaction  between the parties thereto and is subject to the terms of the agreement between such parties, as applicable.  You are solely responsible for any disputes you may have with any counterparty or any other party  regarding such agreements and transactions. SUBJECT PERSONS DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY  RELATED TO ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN, BY AND AMONG YOU AND ANY USERS, SOLVERS,  EXCHANGE, ORBS GUARDIANS OR TRANSACTION COUNTERPARTY. </p><p  class='text-p'>Dependence on Third Party Applications: The Protocol includes smart contracts launched on one or more  underlying blockchain networks that takes orders for transactions that are executed by or with the assistance  of Solvers. All underlying blockchain networks, wallet software, Solvers and Exchanges are third parties  or third party applications, as the case may be. No Subject Person owns or controls these or any other third </p><p  class='text-p'>party site, product or service that you may choose to access, visit or use in the course or for the purpose of  interacting with the Protocol. Accordingly, by using the Protocol, you acknowledge and agree that no  Subject Person has control over, or any duty to take any action regarding any activities of such third parties.  No Subject Person makes any warranties or representations, express or implied, about any linked third party  application, its ownership or operation, the information contained on such application or the suitability of  such products or services. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your  use of any third-party website, applications, or resources. </p><p  class='text-p'>Risk Disclosures Regarding the Protocol: By utilizing the Service or interacting with the Protocol in any  way, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic and blockchain  systems; and warrant that you have an understanding of the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens,  blockchain-based software systems and decentralized finance platforms such as the Exchanges, including,  but not limited to, the following risks:  </p><p  class='text-p'>A. In order to be completed, any transaction created with the Protocol must be confirmed and recorded  on the applicable underlying blockchain. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks  operated by independent third parties, which are not owned, controlled or operated by any Subject  Person. </p><p  class='text-p'>B. No Subject Person controls the actions of nodes on the underlying blockchains, any Solver, or the  Exchanges, and therefore cannot and do not ensure that any transactions you engage in via the  Protocol will be confirmed or confirmed correctly on the relevant networks. The transaction details  you submit via the Protocol may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the  applicable networks used to process the transaction. No Subject Person guarantees that the Protocol </p><p  class='text-p'>can transfer title or right in any digital assets or makes any warranties whatsoever with regard to  title. </p><p  class='text-p'>C. Once transaction details have been submitted via the Protocol, no Subject Person can assist you to  cancel or otherwise modify your transaction or transaction details. </p><p  class='text-p'>D. The Protocol has been designed such that all transactions are either verifiable on-chain or utilize  decentralized technology in order to prevent price manipulation. However, these features are in  beta and may contain bugs, errors and defects or be subject to periods of downtime and unacaia</p><p  class='text-p'>E. If you are using a user interface to interact with the Protocol, such user interface may display  estimated information such as current market price, output tokens to be received in an order or other  information with respect to your entered transactions. All such information displayed on a user  interface may be inaccurate and such user interfaces may contain errors or defects.  </p><p  class='text-p'>F. Use of the Protocol, in particular for trading digital assets, may carry financial risk. Digital assets  are, by their nature, highly experimental, risky, and volatile. Transactions entered into in connection  with the Protocol are irreversible, final and there are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that  you will access and use the Protocol and the Services at your own risk. The risk of loss in trading  digital assets can be substantial. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is  suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. By using the Protocol, you  represent and warrant that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your  independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given transaction and the underlying  digital assets. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication,  professional advice, and experience to make your evaluation of the merits and risks of any  transaction conducted in connection with the Protocol or any digital asset. You accept all  consequences of using the Protocol, including the risk that you may lose access to your digital  assets indefinitely. All transaction decisions are made solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in  these Agreement, no Subject Person accepts any responsibility whatsoever for, and will in no  circumstances be liable to you in connection with, your use of the Protocol for performing digital  asset transactions. </p><p  class='text-p'>G. No financial regulatory authority has reviewed or approved the use of the Orbs-developed software.  Use of the Protocol does not constitute advice or a recommendation concerning any commodity,  security, or other digital asset or instrument. Orbs is not acting as an investment adviser or  commodity trading adviser to any person or entity. </p><h5 id="2-prohibited-conduct"  class='title-h5'

    >The Need for Aggregated Liquidity</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>DEX-AMMs are the driving engine behind the DeFi revolution, as its most fundamental cornerstone. One of the most basic roles of any DEX is to provide its users with the best price possible when executing a trade. Better prices are obtained via better liquidity. However, on-chain liquidity is highly fragmented as it is spread across different chains, across different AMMs within the chain, and across different pools within the AMM.</p><p  class='text-p'>The problem of liquidity fragmentation in DeFi has become acute and directly impacts users via adverse exchange prices and material negative price impact on swaps.</p><p  class='text-p'>This problem contributed to the rise of liquidity aggregators such as <a href="https://1inch.io/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>1inch</a>, <a href="https://www.paraswap.io/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>ParaSwap</a>, <a href="https://swap.cow.fi/#/1/swap/WETH" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>CowSwap</a>, and others. While these aggregators do generally provide better prices as compared to any one individual DEX, thereby making it increasingly difficult for individual DEXs to compete, much of the value saving is routed into the aggregates&#39; pockets in the form of “positive slippage” and the users are not necessarily getting optimal prices.  </p><p  class='text-p'>While in the past, it seemed like most DEXs were focused on safeguarding their liquidity and volume within their own liquidity pool, it has now become ever more obvious that the future of DeFi lies with liquidity aggregation. A notable player who recently chose this path is <a href="https://uniswap.org/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Uniswap</a>, the largest DEX-AMM in existence. UniSwap recently announced <a href="https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswapx-protocol" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>UniswapX</a>, an aggregator interface outsourcing routing complexity to third-party fillers who complete swaps using on-chain third-party liquidity sources.       </p><p  class='text-p'>In light of the above, how can individual DEXs stay competitive in the age of aggregated liquidity?</p><p  class='text-p'>Introducing Liquidity Hub…</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Liquidity Hub by Orbs brings the power of aggregated liquidity to any DEX-AMM, enabling them to provide better price quotes to their users without jeopardizing their liquidity providers.</strong></p><h3 id="what-is-liquidity-hub-"  class='title-h3'
    >What is Liquidity Hub?</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub is an L3 infrastructure software that provides an optimization layer above the AMM, which taps external liquidity for better price quotes and lower price impact.</p><p  class='text-p'>Instead of the typical swap that searches for the best route within the DEX&#39;s limited liquidity pools, Liquidity Hub enhances this process by utilizing additional liquidity sources:</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>1) On-chain solver auction:</strong> Third-party solvers who compete to fill swaps using on-chain liquidity like AMM pools or their own private inventory.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>2) Decentralized orders via API:</strong> Decentralized orders, accessible using API. Enabling institutional/professional traders, such as market makers, to submit bids and compete to fill swaps.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/Liquidity-Hub-by-Orbs-The-New-Standard-for-DEXs/image1.png" alt="infographic"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub allows DEXs to attempt to execute trades without going through the AMM and experiencing AMM price impact. If the layer is unable to execute the trade at a better price than the AMM, the trade will fallback to the AMM contract and execute as usual.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, Liquidity Hub can only improve a trader’s experience. If Liquidity Hub isn’t competitive, meaning it would only execute at a worse price for the user or can’t execute at all, the swap will be routed through the AMM contract directly as usual.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/Liquidity-Hub-by-Orbs-The-New-Standard-for-DEXs/image2.png" alt="flow"></figure></p><h3 id="liquidity-hub-architecture-amp-product-spec"  class='title-h3'
    >Liquidity Hub Architecture &amp; Product Spec</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub is operated by a mix of an on-chain contract (deployed right next to the AMM contract) and backend logic (still running on-chain via Orbs decentralized L3 nodes). In any case, the Liquidity Hub on-chain contract protects end-users and ensures that their funds are safe and significant price manipulations cannot occur.</p><p  class='text-p'>Regular users attempting to swap don’t have to be aware that Liquidity Hub even exists. The Liquidity Hub contract guarantees that the execution price of the swap will be better than the execution price on the AMM contract. In other words, if Liquidity Hub isn’t competitive, it will be avoided. Since this guarantee is implemented at the contract level, there is no trust involved.</p><p  class='text-p'>Part of the Liquidity Hub logic is implemented off of the DEX’s underlying chain (off-chain risks can be mitigated using Orbs L3 as further described below). Since the data structure is held off-chain, adding and removing orders from the Liquidity Hub will take a few milliseconds (without waiting for a new block to be closed) and will not cost gas. All of these properties are attractive for market makers because they are on par with CEXs.</p><p  class='text-p'>All funds are held on-chain in a non-custodial manner. Participants that place an order in Liquidity Hub keep their funds in their own wallet. The Liquidity Hub contract will be approved to initiate the transaction that sends the funds from the account on match. Verification of orders will always take place on-chain through the Liquidity Hub contract. The contract will verify that the execution upholds both sides’ requirements and that the execution price is better than the AMM. On match, the funds will be exchanged between the parties directly on-chain.</p><p  class='text-p'>Below are the key product spec of Liquidity Hub:</p><ul>
<li>No change in the DEX UI for users.</li>
<li>API for solvers + decentralized order interface for MMs Nominal to zero latency execution for users.</li>
<li>Token spending approval by users on MetaMask.</li>
<li>Funds remain in the user wallet until trades execute.</li>
<li>Liquidity Hub trades are gasless for users (although solvers may price gas into their fees)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="liquidity-hub-main-features"  class='title-h3'
    >Liquidity Hub Main Features</h3>
<p  class='text-p'><strong>Avoiding LP Cannibalization</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>One of the primary requirements of Liquidity Hub is to avoid cannibalizing the existing AMM business. </p><p  class='text-p'>This means that existing LPs need to generate the same revenue with Liquidity Hub enabled as they would have generated without it.</p><p  class='text-p'>How is this achieved?</p><p  class='text-p'>The graph below analyzes the performance of Quickswap trades using Dune Analytics. The x-axis is the price impact (percent) suffered per trade. The y-axis is the volume. The graph is calculated over all trades over a long period of time. We’ve executed similar queries on UniSwap and Pancakeswap, and the numbers are actually almost identical.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/Liquidity-Hub-by-Orbs-The-New-Standard-for-DEXs/image3.png" alt="graph"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>The first thing we see in the graph is that price impact has two sides. Negative price impact is where users swap tokens for prices that are worse than market price. These are usually retail users. Positive price impact is where users swap tokens for prices that are better than market price. These are usually institutional arbitrageurs. An AMM is a zero sum game, for every trade with a negative price impact there’s a parallel trade with a positive one.</p><p  class='text-p'>Arbitrageurs have to compete on the positive price impact trades since those are profitable. Ordering the transactions takes place by chain validators, so they are essentially sharing a percentage of the profit with them (via MEV, gas bids, etc). </p><p  class='text-p'>Since Liquidity Hub trades have priority over AMM trades (assuming price for users is similar) and it does not rely on the chain validators for its ordering, Liquidity Hub’s function is effectively to remove these MEV losses and re-distribute them among users, LPs and solvers. In addition, Liquidity Hub’s trades don’t generate any impermanent loss for LPs, which is an improvement over AMM trades.</p><p  class='text-p'>In this way, the DEX keeps its ability to incentivize LPs to keep providing liquidity on its platform.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Cutting Out the Middleman</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub provides MEV protection.</p><p  class='text-p'>As explained above, arbitrage loss to MEV can be significant. Since Liquidity Hub matches orders off-chain (without block producers), it removes MEV losses. These savings are then re-distributed between the users and the DEX itself. This ratio can be set by the platform to best suit its needs.</p><p  class='text-p'>The distribution mechanism is a key differentiator between Liquidity Hub and other protocols such as UniSwapX.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Fully Composable Solution for Solvers</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub is a fully composable DeFi protocol building block.</p><p  class='text-p'>UniSwapX is emerging as a standard for solvers. Liquidity Hub supports UniSwapX and other similar protocols solver (or filler) API, enabling anyone to participate in the bidding process. This feature means that Liquidity Hub can connect to multiple solvers right out of the box. The DEX has the option to pre-approve solvers if it wishes to.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Fully Supports CeFi Market Makers</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub software will allow DEXs to support standard CEX book API allowing traditional MM to participate in DeFi.</p><p  class='text-p'>After having some detailed discussions with industry-leading market makers, we noticed that this class of participants is ill suited for on-chain AMM activity. The core of their business takes place on CEXs and their core expertise is book building. This expertise doesn’t come across on AMMs. Issues like gas costs for unfulfilled orders, inability to cancel orders immediately or simply lack of an order book prevent many market makers from participating in DeFi as much as they would like to.</p><p  class='text-p'>Market makers are one of the primary sources of liquidity in the industry, and the ability for a DEX to bring them into DeFi is a significant advantage. The Liquidity Hub model solves most of the issues that prevent many market makers from participating in DEXs today and opens the gate for market makers to profit from trading on such platforms.</p><p  class='text-p'>This is another key differentiator between Liquidity Hub and UniSwapX, which does not support an order book.</p><h3 id="mitigating-centralization-risks-in-liquidity-hub-using-orbs-l3"  class='title-h3'
    >Mitigating Centralization risks in Liquidity Hub using Orbs L3</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>All on-chain parts are trustless since contracts verify all actions. However, one may be concerned that the off-chain Liquidity Hub backend is able to manipulate trades in some way. This is avoided by using Orbs’ decentralized L3 technology.</p><p  class='text-p'>The <a href="https://orbs.com" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs Network</a> is an open, decentralized and public blockchain infrastructure executed by a secure network of permissionless validators (known as “Guardians”) using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. Orbs is optimized to provide “L3” services, working in conjunction with existing L1 and L2 layers and acting as a “decentralized backend” that enhances the capabilities of EVM smart contracts. Orbs Network mainnet is live since 2019 and has dozens of <a href="https://status.orbs.network/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>active validators</a> staked with <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x01d59af68e2dcb44e04c50e05f62e7043f2656c3" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>over $100M</a>.</p><p  class='text-p'>The network provides its <a href="https://www.orbs.com/execution-services/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>L3 services</a> by operating as a decentralized serverless cloud that allows developers to design applications that extend the capabilities of their smart contracts without relying on traditional centralized server solutions. These applications are deployed to be executed by the Orbs Guardians in a decentralized way.</p><p  class='text-p'>Orbs’ L3 offering is divided into two categories - ORBS-VM and ORBS-Lambda. ORBS-VM is a docker-compatible decentralized virtual machine, similar in concept to AWS EC2. This is designed for more complicated functions. </p><p  class='text-p'>For simpler functions, Orbs Network offers ORBS-Lambda - a decentralized and serverless cloud function solution, similar to AWS-Lambda. Developers can write cloud functions and, when the specified trigger occurs, Orbs Guardians then execute the function on the specified L1 blockchain in a decentralized way. </p><p  class='text-p'>As part of Liquidity Hub, Orbs Guardians will run software utilizing <a href="https://docs.orbs.network/v3/orbs-vm/what-is-orbs-vm" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>ORBS-VM</a> that acts as a decentralized backend that is required for Liquidity Hub’s off-chain portion to run optimally and in a fully decentralized manner. </p><h3 id="summary-liquidity-hub-the-next-evolution-of-dex-amms"  class='title-h3'
    >Summary: Liquidity Hub - the Next Evolution of DEX-AMMs</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub brings the benefit of aggregated liquidity to any DEX-AMM in DeFi.</p><p  class='text-p'>The protocol presents significant benefits to all stakeholders:</p><ul>
<li>DEX <strong>users</strong> enjoy first and foremost better execution prices, as well as other benefits such as MEV protection. As we recall, Liquidity Hub guarantees that the final execution price of a completed transaction is always better than the AMM, all fees included. Users can only save money by using Liquidity Hub.</li>
<li>The <strong>DEX</strong> platform itself can now enjoy added liquidity and increased volumes without cannibalizing its own LP. In addition, the fee mechanism can bring additional fee revenue for the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Solvers</strong>, who are emerging as a key function in DeFi can integrate into Liquidity Hub to expand their services. Moreover, Liquidity Hub has the potential to on-board professional market makers into the space, taking DeFi to the next level.</li>
