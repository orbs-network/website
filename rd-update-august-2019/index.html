<p  class='text-p'>---- SEPARATOR ----</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Blockchain Core</strong></p><p  class='text-p'><em>This segment was contributed by</em> <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pulls/IdoZilberberg" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@IdoZilberberg</em></a></p><p  class='text-p'>This month saw several features come to fruition and several others in the planning phase.</p><p  class='text-p'>Performing any kind of configuration change on the network (modifying timeouts, changing the max number of transactions per block, etc.) as well as adding new nodes, required a restart of the entire network. An important step in making Orbs platform more stable is <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1251" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>hot deployment</a> of new nodes and hot configuration change - this means it&#39;s not necessary to restart the running nodes. This greatly facilitates joining new validator and audit nodes to the network. Making all parts of the platform support hot configuration is a lot of work, so first the TCP transport was updated - this makes hot deployment of new nodes possible. This feature is ready to go to production.</p><p  class='text-p'>Research and planning is underway for proposals to increase the <strong>scalability</strong> of the network. Presently each node holds an open TCP connection to every other node, forming a <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CompleteGraph.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>complete graph</a>. This means every node&#39;s resource consumption increases in linear proportion to the size of the network. This is the easiest model to develop but naturally does not scale well. It is time to consider how the network can operate while a node maintains connections to only a subset of its peers. As a first step, this would involve the audit nodes. Terminology note: &quot;validator&quot; nodes participate in consensus (messages passed between these nodes are quite numerous and time-sensitive), whereas &quot;audit&quot; nodes do not participate in consensus and receive new blocks via the sync mechanism (less messages, are ok to take a little longer to reach).</p><p  class='text-p'>Lean Helix&#39;s new goroutine model is undergoing tests after extensive planning and development by <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pulls/IdoZilberberg" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@IdoZilberberg</em></a> and <a href="https://github.com/ronnno" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@ronnno</em></a> and will be production-ready soon. It solves an inherent problem in the existing algorithm, where slow operations run by Lean Helix cannot be stopped by Leader Election or Node Sync events, even if these render the slow operation obsolete. This had a detrimental effect on liveness and performance of the platform. In the new goroutine model, Leader Election or Node Sync will immediately call the cancel function of the Go context of the slow operation, freeing Lean Helix to continue the consensus flow. Merging into orbs-network-go is underway (<a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1255" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#1255</a>).</p><p  class='text-p'>Research and planning is underway for the concept of a <em>management chain</em> which the other virtual chains will connect to. More info in subsequent updates.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/ronnno" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@ronnno</em></a> extracted the supervisor package of orbs-network-go into a separate <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/govnr" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>repo</a> called <strong>govnr</strong> (&quot;goroutine governor&quot;), so that orbs-network-go and lean-helix-go (and any other repo of course) can use supervised goroutines. The Go language does not allow <em>panic()</em> calls to propagate from one goroutine to another. This means a goroutine can die when <em>panic()</em> is called during its execution, thus rendering the node unusable without raising an alarm. The <em>supervised</em> package catches <em>panic()</em> calls, logs them, and tries to restart the goroutine. This is critical for infinitely-running goroutine such as those in the consensus, Node Sync, Transaction Pool and more.</p><p  class='text-p'>To facilitate testing, <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pulls/electricmonk" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@electricmonk</em></a> added the ability to set the clock time on Gamma (<a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1222" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#1222</a>), similar to what is available on Ganache when developing over Ethereum.</p><p  class='text-p'>Elections timing was based on Ethereum blocks - every n blocks Elections were triggered. Ethereum block time is not constant, and is actually increasing over time, so it is proposed that Orbs platform switchis switching to time-based elections. This feature is being developed by <a href="https://github.com/noambergIL" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@noambergIL</em></a> (<a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-ethereum-contracts/pull/124" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#124</a>). Efficient testing of this significant update required the introduction of an all-Javascript integrative tests framework by <a href="https://github.com/ronnno" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@ronnno</em></a>, and setting the Gamma clock manually (which reduced test time from ~45s to 10-15s) by <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pulls/electricmonk" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@electricmonk</em></a>.</p><p  class='text-p'>Significant progress made by <a href="https://github.com/itamararjuan" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@itamararjuan</em></a> (<a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1249" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#1249</a>) in switching orbs-network-go and its dependencies from vendoring to Go Modules, along with upgrading to Go 1.12.6.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pulls/IdoZilberberg" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@IdoZilberberg</em></a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/itamararjuan" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@itamararjuan</em></a> <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1257" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>resolved a long-standing bug</a> in Gamma tests, which would sometimes fail because one of the nodes would be left behind during consensus and never recover.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pulls/electricmonk" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@electricmonk</em></a> refactored the TCP transport code (<a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1241" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#1241</a> <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1243/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#1243</a>). A hard-earned refactoring tip: every time you spend any nonzero amount of time trying to understand the use of some object name or type, it becomes a candidate for rename. Same goes for any names that require comments to explain them - a short yet comprehensive list of naming guidelines can be found <a href="http://bensmith.io/20-tips-for-better-naming" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>here</a>.</p><p  class='text-p'>Gossip goroutine model change: <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1211" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1211</a> - this increases resilience of the node - previously there was a single Goroutine per peer, meaning that if the current node&#39;s message connection to Lean Helix of some peer was blocked, there was also no connection available for forwarding transactions to that peer. The new update means Lean Helix, Transaction Forwarding, and other topics use separate goroutines and do not block one another.</p><p  class='text-p'>That&#39;s enough for one month!

<p  class='text-p'>---- SEPARATOR ----</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Research and Architecture</strong></p><p  class='text-p'><em>This segment was contributed by</em> <a href="https://github.com/avilanthe1" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@Avilanthe1</em></a></p><p  class='text-p'>Orbs’ research efforts continue with researchers and developers work on different aspects of the Orbs blockchain infrastructure! Here is a breakdown:</p><p  class='text-p'>PoS Research</p><p  class='text-p'>Locking contract</p><p  class='text-p'>Last month, the PoS team’s main effort was to give a full specification of the locking contract. First, we distinguish between Validator locking and Delegator locking. In the past, our primary focus was solely on Validator locking, which was the first step towards a permission-less open-to-competition Validator nomination process. The addition of Delegator locking is an essential feature in the Orbs PoS architecture because we use periodic snapshots, which are susceptible to manipulation if no locking is employed. Additionally, locking would increase attack cost predictability - to attack the network one needs 70% of all delegated stake; without locking, there can be tremendous fluctuations in the amount of delegated stake, thus making the cost of an attack highly unpredictable.</p><p  class='text-p'>Our current planned locking contract architecture is composed of two separate contracts: one for Delegators and one for Validators. Each contract can be upgraded independently. Locking properties, such as locking periods and cool-down periods, may differ between the two contracts. Moreover, more than one locking options may be proposed to the different participants. Conditions for transferring locked coins from one contract to the other are specified. Furthermore, rewards and voting power are increased for locked coins versus unlocked coins.</p><p  class='text-p'>Zero-Knowledge</p><p  class='text-p'>The research team continually explores the subject of zero-knowledge proofs and its role in typical blockchain use cases. In the previous month, the effort focused on the following:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Offloading workload from user to cloud</strong>. Generation of proofs in zero-knowledge is often a significant computational effort, in some cases one that can&#39;t be performed (in a reasonable time) by a user who only uses their cellular phone rather than a powerful computer. Such a user may choose to offload the computation to the cloud, in which case they forfeit their privacy. To fix that, homomorphic encryption may be of use: a client may upload <em>encrypted</em> data to the cloud, which will generate the proofs directly from the encrypted data, thus not undermining the user&#39;s privacy. The research team is exploring this concept to check its feasibility and effectiveness.</li>
<li>Reference string generation. Numerous cryptographic systems entail a preprocessing phase in which a trusted or untrusted party generates what is referred to as a <em>common reference string</em>. For example, the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Zcash is such a cryptographic system. Having in mind that any future zero-knowledge-related application will probably require a reference string generation, the research team studied the generation process, with an emphasis on some parameter tweaking that may enable new and useful features. For example, the &quot;traditional&quot; way of generating the common reference string has a one-point failure: any one of the participating parties may fail the process if they so desire. Using ideas from distributed key generation schemes, we can mediate this issue.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Proof of Custody</p><p  class='text-p'>Orbs network employs a PoS design for Sybil resistance and to economically align the different parties with the protocol instructions. To steer clear of the “fox guarding the henhouse”-issue Orbs network utilizes Ethereum to perform Validators election (see more details <a href="https://www.orbs.com/pos-external-oversight/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>here</a>). For this reason, Orbs Ltd. operates an Ethereum node that is currently the provider of the election data to the Orbs network. This Ethereum node is effectively a single point of failure in the PoS architecture. Therefore, the research team is investigating different methods to resolve this issue to make the Orbs network more decentralized and by that more secure.</p><p  class='text-p'>One obvious “solution” can be to require all Validators to obtain their own Ethereum node. Unfortunately, Validators will have a hard time to comply with such a requirement as operating an Ethereum node incurs non-negligible costs as well as continuous and rigorous maintenance. Therefore, without a proper incentive, we cannot expect Validators to possess their own Ethereum node. Here is where Proof of Custody emerges - it enables Validators to prove succinctly that they hold specific data. In our case, such data can be the current Ethereum state which functions as a witness of one operating an Ethereum node. A proper proof of custody scheme involves proofs that are easy to compute, are of constant-size and can be verified quickly (preferably without interaction with the prover), as well as small size witnesses that can be easily validated in case of prover misbehavior.</p><p  class='text-p'>New Features Architecture</p><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs architecture and research team is extending the Orbs infrastructure by providing a detailed specification of the following new features and improvements:</p><p  class='text-p'>Trigger mechanism</p><p  class='text-p'>This feature enables contract calls that are self-triggered without necessitating an external client call. The trigger mechanism is a block-level hook - appended to the end of every block as a special system transaction. When executed, it triggers the execution of contract methods that were previously registered to the trigger mechanism and meet some predetermined conditions. At the outset, we design the trigger mechanism only to support other system services, some of which are mentioned below.</p><p  class='text-p'>Leader activity reputation</p><p  class='text-p'>This feature implements a simple failure detector intended to decrease the harm incurred to a virtual chain by a malfunctioning block proposer (mainly in terms of throughput).</p><p  class='text-p'>The idea is to record on-chain the activity of the block proposers as reflected in the consensus process. This activity is transformed into a measurable indicator called reputation. Validators reputation is taken into account at the beginning of each new consensus round, decreasing the chance of an inactive block proposer to get elected and vice versa.</p><p  class='text-p'>Management chain</p><p  class='text-p'>Adding the management chain transmutes Orbs infrastructure design from a simple collection of isolated (virtual) chains into a hierarchical one. Its primary purpose is to be a system-wide source of information to all other virtual chains in the Orbs network. As a first step, the management chain will be the sole maintainer of the Validator&#39;s election results, relayed from Ethereum. This solution reduces the resources consumed by Validator nodes, which currently have to relay the results on every virtual chain separately. In the future, the management chain could further serve as a trusted medium for virtual chain interoperability.</p><p  class='text-p'>Redesigning Ethereum mirroring</p><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs PoS data is maintained on Ethereum and relayed to the Orbs network by a mirroring agent. Currently, this process occurs in bursts - at every election event. A more reliable approach is to consume this data in small chunks continuously. The research team is working on a design that replaces the dedicated mirroring agent with the native trigger mechanism described above. Where the recording and processing of data on the Orbs management chain will be a system service.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>--- Separator---</strong></p><p  class='text-p'><strong>&lt;@Nate outro&gt;</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>Till next time,</p><p  class='text-p'>Bella Ciao</p></div></div></div><div class="single-blog-bottom"><h3 class="single-blog-bottom-title">Get involved</h3><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex flex-between"><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/logo.svg" alt="orbs logo"/><h4>White papers</h4><a href="../white-papers" target="_blank">Read the Orbs white papers</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/github.svg" alt="github icon"/><h4>GitHub Repo</h4><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network" target="_blank">Review the code &amp; contribute</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/documents.svg" alt="document icon"/><h4>Documentation</h4><a href="../white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians" target="_blank">Developer documentation</a></div></div></div></main><div class="subscribe" style="display:none"><section class="subscribe-overlay"></section><form class="subscribe-form form"><button type="button" class="form-close-btn" aria-label="Close"><img src="../assets/img/common/close.svg" alt="close"/></button><h3 class="form-title">SUBSCRIBE FOR UPDATES</h3><div class="form-content flex-column"><div class="form-success" style="background:#191919"><p  class='text-p'>Amazing!

    >Potential Difficulties</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Naturally, deploying CBDCs involves certain difficulties, especially during the transition phase. Therefore, all relevant authorities and government agencies must be attentive and responsive in order to effectively mitigate issues as they present themselves.</p><p  class='text-p'>Among the potential difficulties we foresee, we expect the impact on the banking industry to be the most significant. As briefly described in prior witings, banks to some extent might experience a liquidity challenge affecting their available credit reserves, thus making credit more expensive through higher interest rates. There could be several paths to alleviate this and increase cash reserves:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Generating new lines of business - The banking industry could undergo a major shakeup as new blockchain-based platforms are deployed, and many traditional (and highly profitable) services will no longer be provided by banks. It will challenge banks to redefine their role in the new economy and to adapt accordingly. While some banks probably see this as a threat, others could use this as an opportunity to grab substantial market share as the demand for new financial services grows. From the general public&#39;s perspective and even the central bank&#39;s, this spur in competition is positive, forcing banks to become more efficient overall.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Central banks are in control of the deposit discount rate, and are therefore in control of the demand for CBDC and for banks&#39; cash reserves. Therefore, the likeliest scenario is one where the central bank will set an interest rate (on CBDC reserves) to reach a new, improved and stable equilibrium. That equilibrium will see only a limited portion of banks&#39; cash reserves flow to CBDC deposits, not most of it and certainly not all of it. As with other similar kinds of economic stabilization measures, it may take some time for the market to readjust, but the market will reach a new and better state, given that the central bank is trusted by the commercial banks</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The role of central banks is to balance several responsibilities in order to maintain a reliable, growing financial market. Providing the option of opening a CBDC account with the central bank makes any person or entity a de facto customer of the central bank. No one actually intends to have them deal directly with the general public, rather they would essentially outsource this service to commercial banks, generating a new line of business and new stream of revenues</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The new CBDC deposit accounts will not be credit facilities. Those will only be provided by commercial banks. Thus banks will focus on offering their customers active financial services rather than just money storage</p></li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>There may be additional difficulties involved in the process of migrating to CBDC, however we will only discuss two more: user privacy and raising sufficient public awareness.</p><p  class='text-p'>Firstly, privacy and anonymity, especially in the context of payment services, will always be a point of contention. On the one hand, many want full domain over their privacy by having the option to use fully anonymous means of payment. On the other hand, such features might be exploited by nefarious actors for illegal activity and tax evasion. As previously noted, CBDCs may provide different levels of user privacy, depending on the central bank&#39;s policy. The most simple solution would be leaving only the lowest value banknotes available, while limiting the allowed value per cash transaction. That would make the transition towards a true cashless economy smoother and quicker. In certain countries, it may even allow policy makers a defense against critics, as not all cash has been abolished.</p><p  class='text-p'>Secondly, getting the public on board may present difficulties. Public awareness campaigns and proper education should mitigate this. We truly believe that any argument that certain parts of the population could not handle this transition and might be victims for potential fraud are patently absurd. Yes, there will be fraudsters and it will take longer for some to &quot;master&quot; the use of digital payments. However, this genuine concern is not reason enough to reject change outright. Had that been the case, there would have been no move to e-banking, internet or mobile devices. Can you imagine our world today without any of them?</p><h3 id="suggested-strategic-outline"  class='title-h3'
    >Suggested Strategic Outline</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In light of the above, and assuming that we have been able to persuade the reader that CBDCs are a powerful instrument that ought to be adopted by central banks, we suggest the following strategy, which calls for a centralized CBDC on a private blockchain protocol but which allows for development into a decentralized protocol - if the technology proves itself to be viable. Deployment would occur in three steps according to this strategy, spread over several years, but starting sooner rather than later. There is no point in indicating the length of each phase, which would be an open question, but we certainly expect a central bank to set reasonable targets on this roadmap and stick to that plan.</p><ol>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 1 - Introducing CBDC Light, for digital payments only. This currency is the light version of the later full-featured centralized CBDC. The general public may open reserve accounts at the central bank, but they will not carry interest and are intended to be used as the central bank&#39;s certified digital wallets. The goal is to introduce the advantages of using digital payment services and reduce the use of cash to a minimum, leaving only the lowest value bills in circulation. This period will allow commercial banks to start getting used to the idea of having a CBDC, knowing that a full-featured CBDC is waiting just around the corner.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 2 - Introducing a full-featured centralized CBDC. Once the public and commercial banks are accustomed to this lighter CBDC, the central bank upgrades it to a full-featured implementation in order to maximize its merits and utilize it as a full monetary instrument. This period involves potential disruptions to the economy, as discussed above. It is up to the central bank to manage the process carefully in order to drive the economy towards its new equilibrium, in which commercial banks are more efficient and generate new revenue streams. In parallel, the central bank during this time closely examines blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets in order to determine when it would be suitable to deploy a decentralized CBDC</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 3 - Discussing decentralization. As noted earlier, we are still not convinced that CBDC decentralization is necessary or ever will be. Still, we urge central banks to think about it, even if just to push the envelope as a thought-experiment, so that as technology advances, they will be in a position to decide if implementation is the correct strategy for them. We are certain that with time, new technology would provide better solutions to problems that we now cannot see being resolved. Central banks should focus their efforts on understanding several key topics which are critical to a decentralized protocol:</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What is the desired level of user privacy and anonymity?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Who are the participating nodes?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>How does the White chain operate?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What are the KYC &amp; AML procedures for opening an account on that chain?</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion"  class='title-h3'
    >Conclusion</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In this series of posts, we have provided a brief overview of CBDCs and why they should be implemented sooner rather than later. Since CBDCs are such a powerful instrument, their implementation must be calculated and methodical in order to maximize their merits and minimize their demerits.</p><p  class='text-p'>The roles and importance of major actors in our global economy are constantly questioned as we head towards a &#39;new economy&#39;. Each and every one of them will have to adapt to technological innovation in order to maintain relevance and in their position of maintaining market stability. The same goes for central banks. Being the economy&#39;s equivalent of the &quot;responsible adults&quot; in the room, they must engage.</p><p  class='text-p'>We support the recent trend of central banks experimenting and considering issuing a CBDC. In our view, central banks that are looking to lead rather than be led, cannot ignore the potential benefits of this opportunity nor the pitfalls of failing to follow what seems like an inevitable culmination of digital economic innovation over the last two decades.</p></div></div></div></ul></div><div class="footer-tweets"><section class="footer-section-title"><img
