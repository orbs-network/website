    >Risks and rewards of liquidity farming</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Most popular DEXes are similar in concept to <a href="https://info.uniswap.org/pairs" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Uniswap</a> and rely on the same risk/reward model. Some examples include <a href="https://app.sushi.com/farms/permanent" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>SushiSwap</a>, <a href="https://1inch.exchange/#/dao/pools?network=1" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>1inch</a> and <a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/farms" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>PancakeSwap</a>. To understand how their incentives work, digging into the Uniswap model is probably enough.</p><p  class='text-p'>Let’s assume we are providing liquidity on a ETH/USDC pool.</p><p  class='text-p'>The classic Uniswap incentives model for liquidity providers is based on 3 main parts:</p><ol>
<li><strong>Reward</strong> — Swap fees. Every time a trader performs a swap on the pool (swaps ETH to USDC or USDC to ETH in our example), liquidity providers are awarded a swap fee of 0.3%. This fee is divided pro rata and increases the value of the LP tokens each provider holds.</li>
<li><strong>Risk</strong> — Impermanent loss (IL). When a swap takes place, the price of the pair changes. Arbitrageurs usually work to mirror the external market price and are incentivized to continue swapping until the pool reflects it. As the price moves away from the point the liquidity provider entered, the liquidity provider accrues a loss. It is called “impermanent” because it is not made permanent until the provider removes liquidity, so if the price returns to the entry point, this loss disappears.</li>
<li><strong>Reward</strong> — Farming rewards. Projects often distribute their governance token (UNI/SUSHI/1INCH/CAKE) to liquidity providers to further incentivize them to participate. This reward is divided pro-rata and according to time — usually a small amount every block. Not all pairs usually participate, so this is very dependent on the current incentives program each project’s governance has chosen to give.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="is-being-a-liquidity-provider-always-profitable-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Is being a liquidity provider always profitable?</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>No. Since we have 2 main rewards and 1 main risk, it all depends on how they balance together. There are multiple factors at play here, like external market prices, how long the liquidity provider spent in the pool, the swap volume in the pool, total liquidity and so forth. Let’s go over some of them quickly:</p><ul>
<li>Trade volume — the more swap volume (people swapping through the pool), the more swap fees, better for the LP.</li>
<li>Price change — the more price change (in ETH/USDC for example, it doesn’t matter if ETH goes up or down), the more IL, worse for the LP.</li>
<li>Rewards/governance token price — if SUSHI goes up, farming rewards are more valuable, better for the LP.</li>
<li>Total liquidity — the more TVL (Total Value Locked), rewards distribute over more farmers so each one gets less, worse for the LP.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Generally speaking, the popular farming pairs like ETH/USDC are usually profitable for liquidity providers. Why? Because if they weren’t, there would be no liquidity in them.</p><h2 id="diving-into-impermanent-loss"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Diving into impermanent loss</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>We mentioned that IL stems from price change between the two tokens in the pair. In our ETH/USDC example, this happens when ETH goes up or down in price compared to USDC.</p><p  class='text-p'>How would a liquidity provider experience IL?</p><p  class='text-p'>Let’s say that on day 1, ETH price is $2000, and the LP adds 100 ETH and 200,000 USDC (adding liquidity must be balanced). On day 30, when the LP removes liquidity, ETH price is higher and is now $2500. When the LP exits, they would not receive their original 100 ETH and 200,000 USDC back, instead they will receive 89.44 ETH and 223,606.80 USDC.</p><p  class='text-p'>Is this good or bad? Since price of ETH moved, we know that it must be bad because we have IL. Let’s see how bad exactly:</p><p  class='text-p'>The total USD value on exit (89.44 ETH and 223,606.80 USDC with ETH at $2500) is $447,213.60. If the LP had never participated in the pool, and kept their original 100 ETH and 200,000 USDC outside, the total USD value of their holdings would have been $450,000.00 (100 ETH and 200,000 USDC with ETH at $2500). This means the LP lost $2,786 which is about 0.62%.</p><p  class='text-p'>Is this a bad deal? Usually no, assuming swap fees and rewards earn much more than this 0.62% loss.</p><p  class='text-p'>The following table will help us explore IL as ETH price moves in various amounts (+25%, -25%, +50%, -50%, +75%, -75%):</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/single-sided-farming-on-any-dex-via-orbs-liquidity-nexus-part-2/1_8fucWsEI_LFkMZIZn31iLw-1030x242.png" alt=""></figure></p><h2 id="dividing-il-between-two-parties"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Dividing IL between two parties</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>The concept we’re investigating in this series of posts is sourcing liquidity for ETH/USDC farming from two different parties — one party that provides the ETH and the other party that provides the USDC.</p><p  class='text-p'>For discussion sake, let’s assume there are no swap fees, no farming rewards but ETH price changes — so we just have IL. How can we split IL between the two parties?</p><h3 id="strategy-1-all-il-on-the-eth-side"  class='title-h3'
    >Strategy 1 — all IL on the ETH side</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In our <a href="../single-sided-farming-on-any-dex-via-orbs-liquidity-nexus-part-1" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, we’ve seen that the different parties have different goals, so the risk does not necessarily have to be divided equally. The exciting parts of the Liquidity Nexus protocol actually come when things are asymmetric.</p><p  class='text-p'>Let’s try to make things completely asymmetric and make the ETH side responsible for all IL. This can make sense because DeFi players providing ETH can be offered higher portion of the rewards (higher APY) in exchange of taking more of the crypto volatility risk. CeFi players providing the USDC will compromise on lower rewards (lower APY), particularly if their exposure to crypto volatility is limited.</p><p  class='text-p'>How would that work in practice? Let’s go back to the numerical example from before. On day 1, ETH price is $2000. <em>Side A</em> supplies 100 ETH and <em>Side B</em> supplies 200,000 USDC. On day 30, when the sides want to remove liquidity, ETH price is higher and is now $2500. When the LP tokens are burned, instead of the original 100 ETH and 200,000 USDC, we now have 89.44 ETH and 223,606.80 USDC.</p><p  class='text-p'>If <em>Side B</em> does not suffer any IL, the fact that ETH price moved to $2500 should not affect it at all. Since our example only has IL and no rewards and no fees, <em>Side B</em> should withdraw exactly the 200,000 USDC it originally deposited. Since we have 223,606.80 USDC available on exit, after returning the 200,000, we have 23,606.80 USDC remaining. We will naturally use this remainder to compensate <em>Side A</em> as much as possible.</p><p  class='text-p'>Let’s run the numbers and compare to the table from before:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/single-sided-farming-on-any-dex-via-orbs-liquidity-nexus-part-2/1_3KFuTfgeVYL5l1FBxp-bA-1030x164.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>We can see that the IL for <em>Side A</em> is roughly doubled, which makes sense because only one side is taking on all of it. A different and interesting way of looking at this strategy is saying that <em>Side B</em> doesn’t actually really farm. Instead, <em>Side B</em> is giving a loan of USDC to <em>Side A.</em> But this loan is much more efficient than those available on Compound and Aave. The efficiency stems from the fact that the collateral doesn’t just sit there, it is actively farming and generating high yield. Since contracts will implement this behavior, we can allow <em>Side B</em> to reclaim their USDC at any time by automatically unwinding the LP position when they do so. In other words, even if the collateral is farming, there isn’t much added risk.</p><p  class='text-p'>Another interesting edge condition worth mentioning is what happens if ETH value drops by 75%. It is true that this is a bit extreme, but exploring the extremes helps us fine-tune the economics. In this case, you can see that <em>Side A</em>, that provided the ETH, loses all of its capital.</p><p  class='text-p'>Does this make sense? There’s no right or wrong answer. It may be justified by the following:</p><ul>
<li>If we look at this as a loan, it is normal to define boundaries where liquidations take place and expect the side risking liquidation to unwind the position before those happen. If <em>Side A</em> notices that ETH price starts dropping, they can reasonably be expected to withdraw before suffering major losses.</li>
<li>Our example is ignoring swap fees and rewards. In the majority of cases, swap fees alone are enough to counter IL. If this weren’t the case, all LPs would be losing money and nobody would provide any liquidity. If we add back the fees and rewards to this example, <em>Side A</em> would no longer be losing all of their capital.</li>
<li>This loss is impermanent, it only becomes permanent if liquidity is removed. If ETH dips by 75% in a short period of time, history so far showed that given enough time, it will bounce back. <em>Side A</em> can simply remain in position until this hopefully happens.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Nevertheless, you may not like this behavior, so we can tweak the algorithm slightly to avoid it and divide IL in a different way:</p><h3 id="strategy-2-il-on-eth-only-if-eth-goes-up"  class='title-h3'
    >Strategy 2 — IL on ETH only if ETH goes up</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Here’s another interesting alternative. Looking at the table of strategy 1, we can see that when ETH goes up, the model behaves nicely. The edge conditions come when ETH starts dropping, particularly to extremes of over 75%.</p><p  class='text-p'>What if the USDC side shares some of the IL in this case? This wouldn’t give it complete protection against crypto volatility, but will be able to protect the other side from serious losses.</p><p  class='text-p'>How would that work? If ETH goes up, we behave like in strategy 1. So let’s examine a case where ETH goes down with numbers in our previous example. On day 30, this time, when the sides want to remove liquidity, ETH price is lower and is now $1500. When the LP tokens are burned, instead of the original 100 ETH and 200,000 USDC, we instead have 115.47 ETH and 173,205.08 USDC.</p><p  class='text-p'>Protecting <em>Side A</em> to the fullest in this case would maintain its principal of 100 ETH. This would leave extra 15.47 ETH which we can use to compensate <em>Side B</em> as it would incur a small loss. It’s an interesting question whether we want to keep this 15.47 ETH as ETH or swap it to USDC. On one hand, <em>Side B</em> prefers to work in USDC, so swapping makes sense. On the other hand, if ETH just dropped in price, this might be a bad time to sell. Let’s leave this question open for now.</p><p  class='text-p'>Let’s run the numbers and compare to the table from before:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/single-sided-farming-on-any-dex-via-orbs-liquidity-nexus-part-2/1_Blcfyf3fnoXXrnsFZVpvpw-1030x214.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>One of the things I like about this strategy is that it has a nice back story. We have to share the IL risk somehow, there’s no working around it. If ETH goes up in price, the ETH supplying side just made a lot of money — meaning they can bear the IL on themselves and keep a happy smile. If ETH goes down, the ETH supplying side is already in the red, so this is the time to share the pain. The added bonus for the USDC supplying side is that when this happens, they’re actually buying some ETH for a low price — and buying the dip has a great upside potential.</p><h3 id="strategy-3-splitting-il-down-the-middle"  class='title-h3'
    >Strategy 3 — splitting IL down the middle</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>For completeness, let’s also present the numbers we get if we were to split IL equally between the two parties. The calculation is quite simple and has a very nice air of symmetry about it.</p><p  class='text-p'>Back to our usual example.. On day 30, when the sides want to remove liquidity, ETH price is higher and is now $2500. When the LP tokens are burned, instead of the original 100 ETH and 200,000 USDC, we have 89.44 ETH and 223,606.80 USDC. <em>Side A</em> has a small loss over its principal of 100 ETH, and <em>Side B</em> has a small gain over its principal of 200,000 USDC. Can we find a number down the middle where both sides have the exact same loss over their principal?</p><p  class='text-p'>The magic number is taking exactly 24,845.2 USDC and swapping it to ETH. This will give us 99.38 ETH and 198,761.60 USDC. This means both sides now share a slight loss. How slight? Exactly 0.62% over their initial principal investment. This 0.62% figure should be familiar — this is exactly the IL that we had earlier when doing standard double-sided farming.</p><p  class='text-p'>Let’s run the numbers and compare to the tables above:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/single-sided-farming-on-any-dex-via-orbs-liquidity-nexus-part-2/1_Zka4CQ79BqRR9Tmw7UFQxw-1030x164.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>This strategy is very symmetrical and this is indeed quite elegant, but I have to say that personally I don’t like it. When doing single-sided farming, the two parties are never equal. Forcing symmetry, though elegant, is not necessarily a good thing.</p><h2 id="summary"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Summary</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>The purpose of this post was to show how we can implement different strategies to share IL between two parties engaged in single-sided farming together. Each of these strategies may appeal to some and has advantages and disadvantages.</p><p  class='text-p'>We’re not limited by these three alone. We can also mix them together and form interesting combinations, for example — take 50% of strategy 1 and 50% of strategy 3. So IL is not perfectly equal, but we do favor protecting the USDC side.</p><p  class='text-p'>We haven’t mentioned the rewards when discussing these strategies either. If farming together yields 40% APY in SUSHI reward tokens, we still have an open question of how to divide the rewards between the parties. It makes sense to assume that if IL is not shared equally, so won’t the rewards. Naturally, the party exposed to more risk should also reap higher rewards.</p><h2 id="learn-more"  class='title-h2 sub-title'

    >Potential Difficulties</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Naturally, deploying CBDCs involves certain difficulties, especially during the transition phase. Therefore, all relevant authorities and government agencies must be attentive and responsive in order to effectively mitigate issues as they present themselves.</p><p  class='text-p'>Among the potential difficulties we foresee, we expect the impact on the banking industry to be the most significant. As briefly described in prior witings, banks to some extent might experience a liquidity challenge affecting their available credit reserves, thus making credit more expensive through higher interest rates. There could be several paths to alleviate this and increase cash reserves:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Generating new lines of business - The banking industry could undergo a major shakeup as new blockchain-based platforms are deployed, and many traditional (and highly profitable) services will no longer be provided by banks. It will challenge banks to redefine their role in the new economy and to adapt accordingly. While some banks probably see this as a threat, others could use this as an opportunity to grab substantial market share as the demand for new financial services grows. From the general public&#39;s perspective and even the central bank&#39;s, this spur in competition is positive, forcing banks to become more efficient overall.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Central banks are in control of the deposit discount rate, and are therefore in control of the demand for CBDC and for banks&#39; cash reserves. Therefore, the likeliest scenario is one where the central bank will set an interest rate (on CBDC reserves) to reach a new, improved and stable equilibrium. That equilibrium will see only a limited portion of banks&#39; cash reserves flow to CBDC deposits, not most of it and certainly not all of it. As with other similar kinds of economic stabilization measures, it may take some time for the market to readjust, but the market will reach a new and better state, given that the central bank is trusted by the commercial banks</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The role of central banks is to balance several responsibilities in order to maintain a reliable, growing financial market. Providing the option of opening a CBDC account with the central bank makes any person or entity a de facto customer of the central bank. No one actually intends to have them deal directly with the general public, rather they would essentially outsource this service to commercial banks, generating a new line of business and new stream of revenues</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The new CBDC deposit accounts will not be credit facilities. Those will only be provided by commercial banks. Thus banks will focus on offering their customers active financial services rather than just money storage</p></li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>There may be additional difficulties involved in the process of migrating to CBDC, however we will only discuss two more: user privacy and raising sufficient public awareness.</p><p  class='text-p'>Firstly, privacy and anonymity, especially in the context of payment services, will always be a point of contention. On the one hand, many want full domain over their privacy by having the option to use fully anonymous means of payment. On the other hand, such features might be exploited by nefarious actors for illegal activity and tax evasion. As previously noted, CBDCs may provide different levels of user privacy, depending on the central bank&#39;s policy. The most simple solution would be leaving only the lowest value banknotes available, while limiting the allowed value per cash transaction. That would make the transition towards a true cashless economy smoother and quicker. In certain countries, it may even allow policy makers a defense against critics, as not all cash has been abolished.</p><p  class='text-p'>Secondly, getting the public on board may present difficulties. Public awareness campaigns and proper education should mitigate this. We truly believe that any argument that certain parts of the population could not handle this transition and might be victims for potential fraud are patently absurd. Yes, there will be fraudsters and it will take longer for some to &quot;master&quot; the use of digital payments. However, this genuine concern is not reason enough to reject change outright. Had that been the case, there would have been no move to e-banking, internet or mobile devices. Can you imagine our world today without any of them?</p><h3 id="suggested-strategic-outline"  class='title-h3'
    >Suggested Strategic Outline</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In light of the above, and assuming that we have been able to persuade the reader that CBDCs are a powerful instrument that ought to be adopted by central banks, we suggest the following strategy, which calls for a centralized CBDC on a private blockchain protocol but which allows for development into a decentralized protocol - if the technology proves itself to be viable. Deployment would occur in three steps according to this strategy, spread over several years, but starting sooner rather than later. There is no point in indicating the length of each phase, which would be an open question, but we certainly expect a central bank to set reasonable targets on this roadmap and stick to that plan.</p><ol>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 1 - Introducing CBDC Light, for digital payments only. This currency is the light version of the later full-featured centralized CBDC. The general public may open reserve accounts at the central bank, but they will not carry interest and are intended to be used as the central bank&#39;s certified digital wallets. The goal is to introduce the advantages of using digital payment services and reduce the use of cash to a minimum, leaving only the lowest value bills in circulation. This period will allow commercial banks to start getting used to the idea of having a CBDC, knowing that a full-featured CBDC is waiting just around the corner.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 2 - Introducing a full-featured centralized CBDC. Once the public and commercial banks are accustomed to this lighter CBDC, the central bank upgrades it to a full-featured implementation in order to maximize its merits and utilize it as a full monetary instrument. This period involves potential disruptions to the economy, as discussed above. It is up to the central bank to manage the process carefully in order to drive the economy towards its new equilibrium, in which commercial banks are more efficient and generate new revenue streams. In parallel, the central bank during this time closely examines blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets in order to determine when it would be suitable to deploy a decentralized CBDC</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 3 - Discussing decentralization. As noted earlier, we are still not convinced that CBDC decentralization is necessary or ever will be. Still, we urge central banks to think about it, even if just to push the envelope as a thought-experiment, so that as technology advances, they will be in a position to decide if implementation is the correct strategy for them. We are certain that with time, new technology would provide better solutions to problems that we now cannot see being resolved. Central banks should focus their efforts on understanding several key topics which are critical to a decentralized protocol:</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What is the desired level of user privacy and anonymity?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Who are the participating nodes?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>How does the White chain operate?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What are the KYC &amp; AML procedures for opening an account on that chain?</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion"  class='title-h3'
    >Conclusion</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In this series of posts, we have provided a brief overview of CBDCs and why they should be implemented sooner rather than later. Since CBDCs are such a powerful instrument, their implementation must be calculated and methodical in order to maximize their merits and minimize their demerits.</p><p  class='text-p'>The roles and importance of major actors in our global economy are constantly questioned as we head towards a &#39;new economy&#39;. Each and every one of them will have to adapt to technological innovation in order to maintain relevance and in their position of maintaining market stability. The same goes for central banks. Being the economy&#39;s equivalent of the &quot;responsible adults&quot; in the room, they must engage.</p><p  class='text-p'>We support the recent trend of central banks experimenting and considering issuing a CBDC. In our view, central banks that are looking to lead rather than be led, cannot ignore the potential benefits of this opportunity nor the pitfalls of failing to follow what seems like an inevitable culmination of digital economic innovation over the last two decades.</p></div></div></div></ul></div><div class="footer-tweets"><section class="footer-section-title"><img
