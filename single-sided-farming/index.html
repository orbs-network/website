rel="noopener">Liquidity Nexus protocol introduces</a> CeFi liquidity to DeFi.</em></p><p  class='text-p'><em>Now, take any DEX, whether it’s SushiSwap or PancakeSwap, and choose a popular pool like ETH/USDC or BNB/BUSD.</em></p><p  class='text-p'><em>The CeFi capital provides the stable side — USDC or BUSD. The DeFi capital provides the crypto side — ETH or BNB. Now, let them farm together.</em></p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><h2 id="not-all-liquidity-is-created-equal"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Not all liquidity is created equal</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>In the Orbs project, we’ve been experimenting with the idea of CeFi sourced liquidity in DeFi for a while now. One of the interesting things we’ve learned is that different capital providers have different risk appetites and different goals.</p><p  class='text-p'>We learned that not all liquidity is created equal.</p><p  class='text-p'>Consider two very different typecasts of capital providers that sit on opposite edges of the investor spectrum:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'><strong><em>Type A</em></strong> is a typical crypto ape. They are long on crypto. They hold a portfolio that is primarily exposed to volatile crypto assets. They hold a significant percentage in BTC, a significant percentage in ETH and a significant percentage in alts. For them, hodling USDC for too long feels like holding a melting ice cube as the global money printer goes brrr.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'><strong><em>Type B</em></strong> has a more traditional outlook. For them, high risk means allocating a large percentage of their portfolio towards NASDAQ. Their benchmark is fiat. Holding crypto assets is something they’ve only considered after seeing Tesla doing the same. But it’s a bit too avant-garde now, maybe next year, and definitely not more than 3% of the portfolio.</p></li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>These two personas are polar opposites but we’ve been seeing a lot of both types lately.</p><p  class='text-p'><em>Type A</em> is the crowd you usually see roaming the DeFi world. They’re already holding crypto assets, so applying these assets to DeFi is a natural way to push towards higher returns with crypto as a benchmark. Most DeFi products are designed towards them and speak their language. This crowd feels at home with MetaMask. Among all DeFi products, they particularly love vaults like <a href="https://yearn.finance/"title="link" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>yearn.finance</a>, <a href="https://harvest.finance/"title="link" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>harvest.finance</a>,<a href="https://autofarm.network/"title="link" rel="noopener" target='_blank'> autofarm.network</a> and <a href="https://app.acryptos.com/"title="link" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>acryptos</a> because those provide the best APY with the least amount of effort.</p><p  class='text-p'><em>Type</em> B is the crowd you usually see roaming the CeFi world — corporations, institutionals, family offices, classic hedge funds. They have access to large cash reserves, but often limit themselves to the standard instruments like bonds and securities. It’s very difficult to introduce them to the marvels of DeFi, because diving into DeFi requires first to dip your toes in crypto. As much as we would like to think BTC is becoming mainstream, it’s still held by a humblingly low amount of people. Education takes time.</p><p  class='text-p'>The beauty of the Orbs Liquidity Nexus protocol is its potential to bridge <em>Type</em> A and Type B together and allow them to pool their capital together for a joint effort using trustless and decentralized smart contracts.</p><h2 id="different-appetites-for-risk-different-rewards"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Different appetites for risk = different rewards</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>If you were to design a yield-bearing position for both crowds, how would you optimize risk/reward to attract as much liquidity as possible?</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'>If you’re designing for <em>Type A</em> — High APY is probably the most important metric. This crowd tends to throw its capital towards positions where the yield is maximal. This crowd is no stranger to risk. They often don’t even consider high exposure to volatile crypto assets as a risk at all (to be honest, dollars are also frightening to be long on). For them, dealing with <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained"title="link" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Impermanent Loss</a> (IL) is usually not an issue and they love farm rewards.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>If you’re designing for <em>Type B</em> — The first order of business would be to minimize the exposure to crypto. They can’t have their portfolio suffer if ETH jumped up or down 20% overnight. They will definitely compromise on APY because they’re used to the yields of the CeFi world which are much lower. The concept of IL is more difficult for them to grasp because IL is triggered primarily by volatility in the crypto markets which they prefer not to be exposed to.
It seems that we have a match made in heaven. Two sides looking for quite different things. We can play off that.</p></li>

<p  class='text-p'>It seems that we have a match made in heaven. Two sides looking for quite different things. We can play off that.</p><h2 id="the-dream-of-single-sided-farming"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >The dream of single-sided farming</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>The DeFi community has been toying with the idea of single-sided farming for quite a while now. If you’ve participated in farming at any point, you’re probably aware that farming usually comes in pairs. Why is that? It’s because normally farming rewards go towards incentivizing liquidity — and liquidity requires at least two sides.</p><p  class='text-p'>What were the most popular farming positions so far in the short history of DeFi?</p><p  class='text-p'>The first that comes to mind is probably SushiSwap. Taking the beautifully simple architecture of Uniswap and throwing in SUSHI — the LP (liquidity provider) rewards token, which was distributed to the most popular pairs on Uniswap to encourage the liquidity vampire attack.</p><p  class='text-p'>In the second place, I’ll probably say — the Uniswap initial distribution of UNI, that came as a direct response to the Sushi vampire attack. These memorable four positions generated hefty yields and attracted the first very impressive TVL that surpassed $1B.</p><p  class='text-p'>For the third, I’ll probably say — the initial distribution of 1INCH in the pools that were previously known as Mooniswap. The 1inch protocol did wonderfully and managed to amass impressive TVL very quickly, beating Sushi in APY simply because 2/3 of SUSHI rewards are locked for 6 months, and beating Uniswap easily.. well, because UNI are no longer distributed.</p><p  class='text-p'>These three of the most successful farming positions in history are actually very similar in nature. All three are based on liquidity providers in Uniswap-like DEXes. All three focus on the most popular pairs on these platforms, which are usually ETH/USDC, ETH/USDT and ETH/WBTC.</p><p  class='text-p'>If you’ve participated in any of the above, you probably know that the most annoying thing was allocating exactly 50% of each asset in order to farm. If your long-term portfolio normally has 60% BTC, 30% ETH and 10% USDC — good luck trying to create equally balanced pairs and effectively utilize all of your holdings.</p><p  class='text-p'>This notion has made the idea of single-sided farming very appealing a long time ago.</p><h2 id="alternatives-to-single-sided-farming"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Alternatives to single-sided farming</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Before we jump into single-sided farming, let’s explore the current alternatives. Largely, there are two:</p><ol>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Bite the bullet and exchange some assets for the duration of the farm — This approach is very simple. Instead of maintaining your original portfolio distribution of 60% BTC, 30% ETH, 10% USDC, just swap between them and change the allocations. What’s wrong with this approach? It defeats the idea of having long exposure to certain assets and using DeFi to maximize yields. If you’re long on BTC as a benchmark, swapping it for a whole bunch of USDC for a little APY doesn’t make sense. You’re about to lose a lot more if BTC were to go into another bull run. In addition, this approach suffers from slippage because swapping large amounts of base assets at once is the worst way to get a good price.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Lending — If you don’t want to buy these assets, why not borrow them? Isn’t this exactly what Compound and Aave were invented for? Well, they do solve a lot of the problems in alternative 1, but they bring in several new disadvantages. One of them is low utilization. Borrowing assets introduces a wasteful collateral ratio. If you place your BTC as collateral, you’ll only be able to borrow a significantly smaller amount of USDC. This means that much less of your capital will participate in farming. Another big issue is the fear of liquidation. If these assets suffer a volatile night and you sleep through a 20% price change, you might find yourself liquidated in the morning and be hit with losses. Nobody likes to lose sleep.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="back-to-single-sided-farming"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Back to single-sided farming</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Now that we’ve agreed that there no good alternatives to single-sided farming, the question arises — why is this so annoying to implement?</p><p  class='text-p'>The answer in my eyes is much less a technology issue and more of a product one. Separating the two sides of farming sounds simple in theory. If you have a farming position that requires equal amounts of ETH/USDC, let one side bring in the ETH and the other side bring in the USDC.</p><p  class='text-p'>It gets tricky though when you start splitting the rewards and splitting the risks — IL being the primary one.</p><p  class='text-p'>An equal split along the middle doesn’t feel right, because by bringing in fundamentally different types of assets (USDC is stable for one), means the two parties are inherently unequal.</p><h2 id="enter-liquidity-nexus"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Enter Liquidity Nexus</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>The beauty behind the Liquidity Nexus concept is the marriage between two sides looking for different things.</p><p  class='text-p'>Taking the popular ETH/USDC example from before — It becomes quite natural to let Type A, the native DeFi players, supply the ETH. We can reward them with higher APY (not divide rewards equally), which is exactly what they’re looking for. In return, we will expose them to most (or even all) of the IL. It’s ok, because these are risks that they understand and enjoy.</p><p  class='text-p'>It also becomes quite natural to let Type B, the native CeFi players, supply the USDC. They will happily compromise on lower APY if their exposure to crypto volatility and IL was reduced as well.</p><p  class='text-p'>This is one example of what makes the liquidity nexus exciting.</p><p  class='text-p'>In the next posts of this series, I’ll go into the details (and the code) of how we can implement single-sided farming. Stay tuned.</p><h2 id="learn-more"  class='title-h2 sub-title'

    >Potential Difficulties</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Naturally, deploying CBDCs involves certain difficulties, especially during the transition phase. Therefore, all relevant authorities and government agencies must be attentive and responsive in order to effectively mitigate issues as they present themselves.</p><p  class='text-p'>Among the potential difficulties we foresee, we expect the impact on the banking industry to be the most significant. As briefly described in prior witings, banks to some extent might experience a liquidity challenge affecting their available credit reserves, thus making credit more expensive through higher interest rates. There could be several paths to alleviate this and increase cash reserves:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Generating new lines of business - The banking industry could undergo a major shakeup as new blockchain-based platforms are deployed, and many traditional (and highly profitable) services will no longer be provided by banks. It will challenge banks to redefine their role in the new economy and to adapt accordingly. While some banks probably see this as a threat, others could use this as an opportunity to grab substantial market share as the demand for new financial services grows. From the general public&#39;s perspective and even the central bank&#39;s, this spur in competition is positive, forcing banks to become more efficient overall.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Central banks are in control of the deposit discount rate, and are therefore in control of the demand for CBDC and for banks&#39; cash reserves. Therefore, the likeliest scenario is one where the central bank will set an interest rate (on CBDC reserves) to reach a new, improved and stable equilibrium. That equilibrium will see only a limited portion of banks&#39; cash reserves flow to CBDC deposits, not most of it and certainly not all of it. As with other similar kinds of economic stabilization measures, it may take some time for the market to readjust, but the market will reach a new and better state, given that the central bank is trusted by the commercial banks</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The role of central banks is to balance several responsibilities in order to maintain a reliable, growing financial market. Providing the option of opening a CBDC account with the central bank makes any person or entity a de facto customer of the central bank. No one actually intends to have them deal directly with the general public, rather they would essentially outsource this service to commercial banks, generating a new line of business and new stream of revenues</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The new CBDC deposit accounts will not be credit facilities. Those will only be provided by commercial banks. Thus banks will focus on offering their customers active financial services rather than just money storage</p></li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>There may be additional difficulties involved in the process of migrating to CBDC, however we will only discuss two more: user privacy and raising sufficient public awareness.</p><p  class='text-p'>Firstly, privacy and anonymity, especially in the context of payment services, will always be a point of contention. On the one hand, many want full domain over their privacy by having the option to use fully anonymous means of payment. On the other hand, such features might be exploited by nefarious actors for illegal activity and tax evasion. As previously noted, CBDCs may provide different levels of user privacy, depending on the central bank&#39;s policy. The most simple solution would be leaving only the lowest value banknotes available, while limiting the allowed value per cash transaction. That would make the transition towards a true cashless economy smoother and quicker. In certain countries, it may even allow policy makers a defense against critics, as not all cash has been abolished.</p><p  class='text-p'>Secondly, getting the public on board may present difficulties. Public awareness campaigns and proper education should mitigate this. We truly believe that any argument that certain parts of the population could not handle this transition and might be victims for potential fraud are patently absurd. Yes, there will be fraudsters and it will take longer for some to &quot;master&quot; the use of digital payments. However, this genuine concern is not reason enough to reject change outright. Had that been the case, there would have been no move to e-banking, internet or mobile devices. Can you imagine our world today without any of them?</p><h3 id="suggested-strategic-outline"  class='title-h3'
    >Suggested Strategic Outline</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In light of the above, and assuming that we have been able to persuade the reader that CBDCs are a powerful instrument that ought to be adopted by central banks, we suggest the following strategy, which calls for a centralized CBDC on a private blockchain protocol but which allows for development into a decentralized protocol - if the technology proves itself to be viable. Deployment would occur in three steps according to this strategy, spread over several years, but starting sooner rather than later. There is no point in indicating the length of each phase, which would be an open question, but we certainly expect a central bank to set reasonable targets on this roadmap and stick to that plan.</p><ol>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 1 - Introducing CBDC Light, for digital payments only. This currency is the light version of the later full-featured centralized CBDC. The general public may open reserve accounts at the central bank, but they will not carry interest and are intended to be used as the central bank&#39;s certified digital wallets. The goal is to introduce the advantages of using digital payment services and reduce the use of cash to a minimum, leaving only the lowest value bills in circulation. This period will allow commercial banks to start getting used to the idea of having a CBDC, knowing that a full-featured CBDC is waiting just around the corner.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 2 - Introducing a full-featured centralized CBDC. Once the public and commercial banks are accustomed to this lighter CBDC, the central bank upgrades it to a full-featured implementation in order to maximize its merits and utilize it as a full monetary instrument. This period involves potential disruptions to the economy, as discussed above. It is up to the central bank to manage the process carefully in order to drive the economy towards its new equilibrium, in which commercial banks are more efficient and generate new revenue streams. In parallel, the central bank during this time closely examines blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets in order to determine when it would be suitable to deploy a decentralized CBDC</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 3 - Discussing decentralization. As noted earlier, we are still not convinced that CBDC decentralization is necessary or ever will be. Still, we urge central banks to think about it, even if just to push the envelope as a thought-experiment, so that as technology advances, they will be in a position to decide if implementation is the correct strategy for them. We are certain that with time, new technology would provide better solutions to problems that we now cannot see being resolved. Central banks should focus their efforts on understanding several key topics which are critical to a decentralized protocol:</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What is the desired level of user privacy and anonymity?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Who are the participating nodes?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>How does the White chain operate?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What are the KYC &amp; AML procedures for opening an account on that chain?</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion"  class='title-h3'
    >Conclusion</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In this series of posts, we have provided a brief overview of CBDCs and why they should be implemented sooner rather than later. Since CBDCs are such a powerful instrument, their implementation must be calculated and methodical in order to maximize their merits and minimize their demerits.</p><p  class='text-p'>The roles and importance of major actors in our global economy are constantly questioned as we head towards a &#39;new economy&#39;. Each and every one of them will have to adapt to technological innovation in order to maintain relevance and in their position of maintaining market stability. The same goes for central banks. Being the economy&#39;s equivalent of the &quot;responsible adults&quot; in the room, they must engage.</p><p  class='text-p'>We support the recent trend of central banks experimenting and considering issuing a CBDC. In our view, central banks that are looking to lead rather than be led, cannot ignore the potential benefits of this opportunity nor the pitfalls of failing to follow what seems like an inevitable culmination of digital economic innovation over the last two decades.</p></div></div></div></ul></div><div class="footer-tweets"><section class="footer-section-title"><img
