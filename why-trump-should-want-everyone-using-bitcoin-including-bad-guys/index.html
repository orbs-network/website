In fact, I think that by the end of the conversation, the President would see that he is correct in that there are a few tweaks that need to be made to the cryptocurrency universe, but that overwhelmingly, Bitcoin can help make Make American Law Enforcement Great Again.</p><h2 id="bitcoin-tells-all"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Bitcoin Tells All</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>The most common misconception is that Bitcoin provides its users with full anonymity. In fact, the opposite is true. <em>Bitcoin can only provide pseudo-anonymity in certain aspects and no anonymity whatsoever in others.</em> While Bitcoin can, when used intelligently, help maintain a certain degree of privacy and serve as a tool of economic freedom, at the same time, for many law enforcement efforts, Bitcoin can actually be a brilliant tool for tracking bad guys’ financial actions.</p><p  class='text-p'>First a few basics - all Bitcoin transactions consist of three key parameters: The sender’s address, the recipient’s address and the amount of Bitcoin transferred. Once the transaction is transmitted its (cryptographically stamped) time and date are also immutably written on the chain. Most importantly, <strong>the Bitcoin network is fully available to anyone with internet access. By “fully available” I mean its <em>entire</em> transaction history from day one. Furthermore, it’s immutable, thus it cannot be changed or erased, ever.</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>So if we look at the above parameters, it is clear to understand why the last two do not provide anonymity. For every transaction, the amount of Bitcoin transferred and exactly when it was transferred is recorded and immutable. No one can ever claim that this information was ever concealed, or meant to be concealed. <strong>And, this information will be traceable - forever.</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>Which leaves us with the claim that the addresses provide anonymity. This misconception probably stems from the lack of a standardized ledger that links addresses to their owners, like the ones that exist at every bank. However, this is extremely fragile, for a simple reason - humans interact with each other. Once this supposed anonymity breaks, and it always breaks, it collapses like a house of cards. Below is a simple example that demonstrates this. As it is only supposed to encapsulate the essence of Bitcoin’s pseudo-anonymity, I kept it as simple as possible. Naturally, certain aspects of the Bitcoin protocol are far more complicated, but are out of the scope of our discussion:</p><ul>
<li>I buy a MAGA hat at a store, paying in Bitcoin; in addition</li>
<li>I pay, in Bitcoin, my neighbor some money that I owe her</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Because Bitcoin is fully accessible to everybody, combined with its immutability:</p><ul>
<li>Both my neighbor and I now have access to each other’s <strong><em>entire</em></strong> Bitcoin activity, <strong><em>past and future</em></strong></li>
<li>Assuming that my neighbor once bought a MAGA hat from that same store, she knows that I bought something there, how much I paid <strong><em>and</em></strong> when it happened (obviously, the same goes for me knowing about my neighbor…)</li>
<li>As a result of both, anyone can see anyone else’s current Bitcoin balance</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Just by making these three transactions, my neighbor and I, and the MAGA hat store have lost our Bitcoin anonymity to each other, forever. Imagine that in the “real” world buying a hat, using your credit card, will expose your entire purchase history (and future...) to the store from which you bought. Vice versa, you will have full access to the store’s history (and future) purchase history. Of course, in the case of Bitcoin, the history that is exposed is not the user’s entire history, as only the history linked to that specific wallet is revealed, and the same user may use multiple wallets that are not linked to each other. At the same time, the public nature of the bitcoin blockchain does reveal significantly more information about the flow of funds from one user to another than a typical bank transfer. Especially when combined with information from outside of the blockchain, this data can be very telling about the behavior of users and the networks between them.</p><p  class='text-p'>To summarize: For every Bitcoin transaction, all of the transaction information and the past and future transaction information of the wallet addresses involved, are forever documented, unchangeable, linked and trackable among the users. For law enforcement, this information is a potential gold mine in order to curtail criminal activity.</p><h2 id="bitcoin-is-a-poor-choice-for-bad-guys"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Bitcoin is a Poor Choice for Bad Guys</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Given that we successfully debunked Bitcoin’s “anonymity” myth, doing the same to the second misconception - that Bitcoin is a great tool for bad actors - is easier. Let’s assume that my neighbor and I were buying weapons from an illegal arms dealer (the “store”), and that I happen to be a law enforcement agent working undercover. I would now have access to valuable information, for instance:</p><ul>
<li>Substantial proof that my neighbor has financially interacted with an illegal arms dealer</li>
<li>My neighbor’s and the arms dealer’s entire Bitcoin activity, leading to potential suspects interacting with both</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Again, all this information is out in the open. No warrants required, no courts involved (at least not at this point), nothing. Law enforcement agencies in the past could only dream of having this kind of access to a network conducting illegal activity.</p><p  class='text-p'>A real life example of this was the case of Silk Road, an online market mostly used for drug trading. It launched in February 2011 and operated until October 2013, when the FBI arrested the man allegedly behind it, Ross Ulbricht, a 29-year-old American. According to the complaint filed, “From February 6, 2011, to July 23, 2013, there were approximately 1,229,465 transactions completed on the site. The total revenue generated from these sales was 9,519,664 Bitcoins, and the total commissions collected by Silk Road from the sales amounted to 614,305 Bitcoins…”. Back then it was around $1.0 Billion of revenues and $61 Million in commission. Ulbricht was convicted and sentenced for life in prison without the possibility of parole. Just to make the point of Bitcoin’s faux-anonymity, it was chain analysis <a href="https://qz.com/1236501/the-woman-who-once-policed-the-crypto-world-for-the-us-government-says-a-crackdown-is-coming/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>that led to convicting other suspect</a>s involved in Silk Road. Furthermore, only a few days ago, almost six years after Silk Road was shut down, a man was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/23/man-accused-of-laundering-millions-in-bitcoin-from-silk-road.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>arrested in Ohio</a> for trying to launder $19 Million allegedly earned selling drugs on Silk Road.</p><p  class='text-p'>The irony is that Silk Road’s reliance on Bitcoin’s so-called unprecedented anonymity turned out to be one of the pitfalls that led its leaders straight to the hands of the FBI. There were, of course, other mistakes they made that allowed breakthrough in the investigation, but on a certain level it was similar to our simple example.</p><h2 id="what-the-bad-guys-use-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >What the Bad Guys Use:</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Once my initial point has been proved (that Bitcoin is not anonymous), it would only be fair to note that things have gotten more complicated in the past years when it comes to real anonymity using certain cryptocurrencies. In the eternal cat and mouse game of law enforcement, the bad guys are often the ones who come up with innovative ideas and technology to facilitate their illegal activity.</p><p  class='text-p'>Since Bitcoin can not provide real anonymity to users, other types of cryptocurrencies, such as “Privacy coins”, have been introduced to try and tackle the challenge. As previously noted, it is falsely presumed that Bitcoin can hide users’ identity, though not the transaction metadata (amount and time). Privacy coins are trying to hide it all, using:</p><ul>
<li>Stealth addresses - disposable addresses, changed with each new transaction</li>
<li>Confidential - hiding the amount of tokens transferred, a feature that can be rather easily added to existing protocols</li>
<li>Shielded transactions - hiding both the amount and the addresses</li>
<li>Mixing - third-party services covering the tracks of transactions</li>
<li>Ring Signatures - obscuring transaction metadata with unrelated data as well as for decentralized address mixing</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Just to be clear, I do not accuse anyone involved in the development of these cryptocurrencies of encouraging, supporting, or assisting illegal activity.  Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were created in large part in order to provide more privacy and freedom in financial transactions. It is not surprising that newer blockchain protocols are being designed to provide higher levels of privacy than Bitcoin does. There are many legitimate reasons why people are looking for privacy, and there is a real concern that without additional development, cryptocurrency could be used by corporations or governments to engage in problematic surveillance. Privacy-enhancing protocols therefore are responding to real and valid concerns. Still, they do create challenges for law enforcement, unlike Bitcoin, as was <a href="https://beincrypto.com/monero-privacy-troubles-fbi-bitcoin-not-so-much/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>announced by the FBI</a>. One may assume that if a certain cryptocurrency can provide high-level anonymity, those involved in illegal activities (money laundering, terror, etc.) may use it for their financial operation.</p><h2 id="what-can-the-authorities-do-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >What can the Authorities Do?</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>There is no way around the simple truth that full anonymity, as proposed to be provided by certain privacy coins, is an immense challenge for law enforcement agencies. In recent decades, authorities have systematically increased their efforts in investigating the financial activities of suspects conducting large scale illegal activity. It seems that going after the money is an effective strategy in their war against crime. One of the main reasons is that financial activity over the “traditional” system, sophisticated as it may be, always leaves some kind of a trail. If a “modern” financial system which, theoretically, left no trail was introduced to the criminal world, the results could potentially be disastrous.</p><p  class='text-p'>The bright side is that it’s still not too late. Authorities can still take a few measures in order to prevent potential financial chaos. The following are merely some suggestions to begin with:</p><ul>
<li>Acknowledging the problem - too many law enforcement agencies still bury their heads in the sand. Some are not aware of all the new threats, while others still hope that the use of cryptocurrencies, especially privacy coins, will either cease or will not mature into a significant threat.</li>
<li>Abolishing the use of privacy coins by making them illegal. In my view, this might not be effective as it is practically impossible to prevent anonymous developers from sharing open-source code online. <em>Will the real Satoshi Nakamoto please stand up?...</em> Still, it is plausible that some users will be deterred and will not use those cryptocurrencies, as a result of the declared legal action against them</li>
<li>The golden path, as I see it, should be regulating these cryptocurrencies. Just as governments regulate cybersecurity software, so they should certain cryptocurrencies, given that they risk being a financial hazard. Law enforcement agencies can endorse certain privacy coins as long as certain technological features are embedded in the protocols. These features should allow authorities, and only them, access to the user’s activity. It is up for discussion, whether users should opt-in or out of these features, and whether it should be available at all times or only under certain situations, <em>e.g.</em> court order. Let’s examine some of these features:<ul>
<li>“View key” provides for a “read only” access to a certain blockchain wallet. The protocols that support it provide users with high-level anonymity from the entire network, except for those holding the view key, who get access to the wallet’s transaction history. In existing protocols, users can configure the level of access, <em>e.g.</em> only incoming transactions, with/without metadata, etc. The tricky part would be making sure that the authorities get adequate access that meets their requirements and that users cannot manipulate this access later on. Though this is a technical challenge, it can most likely be solved in the near future.</li>
<li>Deploying protocols such as Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP), to share information between the users and the authorities. Not go into the technical details of ZKP, I will just provide a short example: Let’s assume that the IRS asks President Trump for his profits in cryptocurrency trading last year. Let us also assume that the President can prove to the IRS, <em>mathematically and unequivocally</em>, that his profits were $1,000, however he does not share any additional information concerning any of his underlying assets or the transactions he made. Advanced applications deploying ZKP may allow that. The challenge would be convincing the IRS that they can trust this protocol and its outcomes, without auditing each and every transaction, as they are used to, and only a few days ago <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/irs-sending-warning-letters-to-more-than-10-000-cryptocurrency-holders-11564159523" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>announced that they will start doing so</a> very soon.</li>

    >Summing it up</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Despite the bad rap given to Bitcoin in the President’s tweet, if bad guys want to use cryptocurrencies for illegal actions, it is probably best they use something other than Bitcoin. In this blog post I aimed to show quite clearly that if you want to be anonymous, Bitcoin is not the way to go. It is, however, generally agreed that unregulated cryptocurrencies can facilitate illegal activity. Still, it is safe to assume that cryptocurrencies, and privacy coins, are here to stay. Therefore, authorities cannot afford to ignore these instruments and would benefit from taking action sooner rather than later. Declaring them illegal might be the easiest, though not the wisest, solution and will probably not work. Therefore, intelligent regulation should be the answer. For starters, it may be achieved by providing the technological guidelines for features that these protocols should and should not allow.</p><p  class='text-p'>The general underlying assumption is that most individuals are law abiding citizens who cherish their privacy. They would hate to have their financial history available to all, but would most probably be willing to cooperate with law enforcement agencies when they are asked to do so. As always, it is up to the authorities to find the delicate balance in regulating new technology and certain perils that it may withhold rather than prohibiting it, but it is best that the authorities also realize that there is huge added value in crypto, including assistance with crime fighting, and find a way to regulate but not suffocate.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'>Hexa Foundation is a non-profit organization focused on using blockchain to create social impact.

    >The Need for Aggregated Liquidity</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>DEX-AMMs are the driving engine behind the DeFi revolution, as its most fundamental cornerstone. One of the most basic roles of any DEX is to provide its users with the best price possible when executing a trade. Better prices are obtained via better liquidity. However, on-chain liquidity is highly fragmented as it is spread across different chains, across different AMMs within the chain, and across different pools within the AMM.</p><p  class='text-p'>The problem of liquidity fragmentation in DeFi has become acute and directly impacts users via adverse exchange prices and material negative price impact on swaps.</p><p  class='text-p'>This problem contributed to the rise of liquidity aggregators such as <a href="https://1inch.io/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>1inch</a>, <a href="https://www.paraswap.io/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>ParaSwap</a>, <a href="https://swap.cow.fi/#/1/swap/WETH" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>CowSwap</a>, and others. While these aggregators do generally provide better prices as compared to any one individual DEX, thereby making it increasingly difficult for individual DEXs to compete, much of the value saving is routed into the aggregates&#39; pockets in the form of “positive slippage” and the users are not necessarily getting optimal prices.  </p><p  class='text-p'>While in the past, it seemed like most DEXs were focused on safeguarding their liquidity and volume within their own liquidity pool, it has now become ever more obvious that the future of DeFi lies with liquidity aggregation. A notable player who recently chose this path is <a href="https://uniswap.org/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Uniswap</a>, the largest DEX-AMM in existence. UniSwap recently announced <a href="https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswapx-protocol" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>UniswapX</a>, an aggregator interface outsourcing routing complexity to third-party fillers who complete swaps using on-chain third-party liquidity sources.       </p><p  class='text-p'>In light of the above, how can individual DEXs stay competitive in the age of aggregated liquidity?</p><p  class='text-p'>Introducing Liquidity Hub…</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Liquidity Hub by Orbs brings the power of aggregated liquidity to any DEX-AMM, enabling them to provide better price quotes to their users without jeopardizing their liquidity providers.</strong></p><h3 id="what-is-liquidity-hub-"  class='title-h3'
    >What is Liquidity Hub?</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub is an L3 infrastructure software that provides an optimization layer above the AMM, which taps external liquidity for better price quotes and lower price impact.</p><p  class='text-p'>Instead of the typical swap that searches for the best route within the DEX&#39;s limited liquidity pools, Liquidity Hub enhances this process by utilizing additional liquidity sources:</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>1) On-chain solver auction:</strong> Third-party solvers who compete to fill swaps using on-chain liquidity like AMM pools or their own private inventory.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>2) Decentralized orders via API:</strong> Decentralized orders, accessible using API. Enabling institutional/professional traders, such as market makers, to submit bids and compete to fill swaps.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/Liquidity-Hub-by-Orbs-The-New-Standard-for-DEXs/image1.png" alt="infographic"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub allows DEXs to attempt to execute trades without going through the AMM and experiencing AMM price impact. If the layer is unable to execute the trade at a better price than the AMM, the trade will fallback to the AMM contract and execute as usual.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, Liquidity Hub can only improve a trader’s experience. If Liquidity Hub isn’t competitive, meaning it would only execute at a worse price for the user or can’t execute at all, the swap will be routed through the AMM contract directly as usual.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/Liquidity-Hub-by-Orbs-The-New-Standard-for-DEXs/image2.png" alt="flow"></figure></p><h3 id="liquidity-hub-architecture-amp-product-spec"  class='title-h3'
    >Liquidity Hub Architecture &amp; Product Spec</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub is operated by a mix of an on-chain contract (deployed right next to the AMM contract) and backend logic (still running on-chain via Orbs decentralized L3 nodes). In any case, the Liquidity Hub on-chain contract protects end-users and ensures that their funds are safe and significant price manipulations cannot occur.</p><p  class='text-p'>Regular users attempting to swap don’t have to be aware that Liquidity Hub even exists. The Liquidity Hub contract guarantees that the execution price of the swap will be better than the execution price on the AMM contract. In other words, if Liquidity Hub isn’t competitive, it will be avoided. Since this guarantee is implemented at the contract level, there is no trust involved.</p><p  class='text-p'>Part of the Liquidity Hub logic is implemented off of the DEX’s underlying chain (off-chain risks can be mitigated using Orbs L3 as further described below). Since the data structure is held off-chain, adding and removing orders from the Liquidity Hub will take a few milliseconds (without waiting for a new block to be closed) and will not cost gas. All of these properties are attractive for market makers because they are on par with CEXs.</p><p  class='text-p'>All funds are held on-chain in a non-custodial manner. Participants that place an order in Liquidity Hub keep their funds in their own wallet. The Liquidity Hub contract will be approved to initiate the transaction that sends the funds from the account on match. Verification of orders will always take place on-chain through the Liquidity Hub contract. The contract will verify that the execution upholds both sides’ requirements and that the execution price is better than the AMM. On match, the funds will be exchanged between the parties directly on-chain.</p><p  class='text-p'>Below are the key product spec of Liquidity Hub:</p><ul>
<li>No change in the DEX UI for users.</li>
<li>API for solvers + decentralized order interface for MMs Nominal to zero latency execution for users.</li>
<li>Token spending approval by users on MetaMask.</li>
<li>Funds remain in the user wallet until trades execute.</li>
<li>Liquidity Hub trades are gasless for users (although solvers may price gas into their fees)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="liquidity-hub-main-features"  class='title-h3'
    >Liquidity Hub Main Features</h3>
<p  class='text-p'><strong>Avoiding LP Cannibalization</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>One of the primary requirements of Liquidity Hub is to avoid cannibalizing the existing AMM business. </p><p  class='text-p'>This means that existing LPs need to generate the same revenue with Liquidity Hub enabled as they would have generated without it.</p><p  class='text-p'>How is this achieved?</p><p  class='text-p'>The graph below analyzes the performance of Quickswap trades using Dune Analytics. The x-axis is the price impact (percent) suffered per trade. The y-axis is the volume. The graph is calculated over all trades over a long period of time. We’ve executed similar queries on UniSwap and Pancakeswap, and the numbers are actually almost identical.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/Liquidity-Hub-by-Orbs-The-New-Standard-for-DEXs/image3.png" alt="graph"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>The first thing we see in the graph is that price impact has two sides. Negative price impact is where users swap tokens for prices that are worse than market price. These are usually retail users. Positive price impact is where users swap tokens for prices that are better than market price. These are usually institutional arbitrageurs. An AMM is a zero sum game, for every trade with a negative price impact there’s a parallel trade with a positive one.</p><p  class='text-p'>Arbitrageurs have to compete on the positive price impact trades since those are profitable. Ordering the transactions takes place by chain validators, so they are essentially sharing a percentage of the profit with them (via MEV, gas bids, etc). </p><p  class='text-p'>Since Liquidity Hub trades have priority over AMM trades (assuming price for users is similar) and it does not rely on the chain validators for its ordering, Liquidity Hub’s function is effectively to remove these MEV losses and re-distribute them among users, LPs and solvers. In addition, Liquidity Hub’s trades don’t generate any impermanent loss for LPs, which is an improvement over AMM trades.</p><p  class='text-p'>In this way, the DEX keeps its ability to incentivize LPs to keep providing liquidity on its platform.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Cutting Out the Middleman</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub provides MEV protection.</p><p  class='text-p'>As explained above, arbitrage loss to MEV can be significant. Since Liquidity Hub matches orders off-chain (without block producers), it removes MEV losses. These savings are then re-distributed between the users and the DEX itself. This ratio can be set by the platform to best suit its needs.</p><p  class='text-p'>The distribution mechanism is a key differentiator between Liquidity Hub and other protocols such as UniSwapX.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Fully Composable Solution for Solvers</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub is a fully composable DeFi protocol building block.</p><p  class='text-p'>UniSwapX is emerging as a standard for solvers. Liquidity Hub supports UniSwapX and other similar protocols solver (or filler) API, enabling anyone to participate in the bidding process. This feature means that Liquidity Hub can connect to multiple solvers right out of the box. The DEX has the option to pre-approve solvers if it wishes to.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Fully Supports CeFi Market Makers</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub software will allow DEXs to support standard CEX book API allowing traditional MM to participate in DeFi.</p><p  class='text-p'>After having some detailed discussions with industry-leading market makers, we noticed that this class of participants is ill suited for on-chain AMM activity. The core of their business takes place on CEXs and their core expertise is book building. This expertise doesn’t come across on AMMs. Issues like gas costs for unfulfilled orders, inability to cancel orders immediately or simply lack of an order book prevent many market makers from participating in DeFi as much as they would like to.</p><p  class='text-p'>Market makers are one of the primary sources of liquidity in the industry, and the ability for a DEX to bring them into DeFi is a significant advantage. The Liquidity Hub model solves most of the issues that prevent many market makers from participating in DEXs today and opens the gate for market makers to profit from trading on such platforms.</p><p  class='text-p'>This is another key differentiator between Liquidity Hub and UniSwapX, which does not support an order book.</p><h3 id="mitigating-centralization-risks-in-liquidity-hub-using-orbs-l3"  class='title-h3'
    >Mitigating Centralization risks in Liquidity Hub using Orbs L3</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>All on-chain parts are trustless since contracts verify all actions. However, one may be concerned that the off-chain Liquidity Hub backend is able to manipulate trades in some way. This is avoided by using Orbs’ decentralized L3 technology.</p><p  class='text-p'>The <a href="https://orbs.com" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs Network</a> is an open, decentralized and public blockchain infrastructure executed by a secure network of permissionless validators (known as “Guardians”) using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. Orbs is optimized to provide “L3” services, working in conjunction with existing L1 and L2 layers and acting as a “decentralized backend” that enhances the capabilities of EVM smart contracts. Orbs Network mainnet is live since 2019 and has dozens of <a href="https://status.orbs.network/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>active validators</a> staked with <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x01d59af68e2dcb44e04c50e05f62e7043f2656c3" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>over $100M</a>.</p><p  class='text-p'>The network provides its <a href="https://www.orbs.com/execution-services/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>L3 services</a> by operating as a decentralized serverless cloud that allows developers to design applications that extend the capabilities of their smart contracts without relying on traditional centralized server solutions. These applications are deployed to be executed by the Orbs Guardians in a decentralized way.</p><p  class='text-p'>Orbs’ L3 offering is divided into two categories - ORBS-VM and ORBS-Lambda. ORBS-VM is a docker-compatible decentralized virtual machine, similar in concept to AWS EC2. This is designed for more complicated functions. </p><p  class='text-p'>For simpler functions, Orbs Network offers ORBS-Lambda - a decentralized and serverless cloud function solution, similar to AWS-Lambda.

    >Summary: Liquidity Hub - the Next Evolution of DEX-AMMs</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub brings the benefit of aggregated liquidity to any DEX-AMM in DeFi.</p><p  class='text-p'>The protocol presents significant benefits to all stakeholders:</p><ul>
<li>DEX <strong>users</strong> enjoy first and foremost better execution prices, as well as other benefits such as MEV protection. As we recall, Liquidity Hub guarantees that the final execution price of a completed transaction is always better than the AMM, all fees included. Users can only save money by using Liquidity Hub.</li>
<li>The <strong>DEX</strong> platform itself can now enjoy added liquidity and increased volumes without cannibalizing its own LP. In addition, the fee mechanism can bring additional fee revenue for the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Solvers</strong>, who are emerging as a key function in DeFi can integrate into Liquidity Hub to expand their services. Moreover, Liquidity Hub has the potential to on-board professional market makers into the space, taking DeFi to the next level.</li>
