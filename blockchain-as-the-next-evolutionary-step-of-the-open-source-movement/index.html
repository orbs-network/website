As a developer, I cannot recall a single day in the last few years where I did not rely on open source software. I’m not the exception. The majority of software engineers today rely on open source daily in their professional lives.</p><p  class='text-p'>For one, open source is dominating developer infrastructure. From operating systems (Linux in the cloud) to databases (MySQL, MongoDB, Redis) to programming languages themselves (JavaScript, Python, Java, C, PHP). It’s not just developers, it’s consumers as well. From what they run on their phones (Android) to how they access the web (Chrome, Firefox).</p><p  class='text-p'>The motivation is clear. Open source is good for humanity. It is making technology more accessible and open — anyone can build anything.</p><h3 id="open-source-was-not-always-mainstream"  class='title-h3'
    >Open source was not always mainstream</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>If you had asked a random developer 20 years ago whether this idea of open software would ever catch on, they would have laughed. Sharing intellectual property, your competitive advantage? absurd. Would it affect real business? barely, it’s a niche. The ones leading it? anarchists, trying to tear down establishments.</p><p  class='text-p'>This is not very far from how many people view blockchain today. Decentralizing control when you can hold on to it? absurd. What is the business use-case? not mainstream, a niche. The ones leading it? anarchists, trying to tear down institutions.</p><p  class='text-p'>With blockchain, it’s actually worse. The inflated cryptocurrency bubble and its recent recession, the abundance of opportunism and over-speculation, are all adding even more suspicion to the mix.</p><h3 id="open-source-and-for-profit-companies"  class='title-h3'
    >Open source and for-profit companies</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In the beginning it seemed that open source and for-profit companies were mutually exclusive. Corporations like Microsoft were hailed as the enemies of open source. Companies saw code as their secret-sauce, which sharing would bring-about their downfall or destroy their competitive edge. Today, nothing is further from the truth.</p><p  class='text-p'>The biggest contributors to open source today are for-profit enterprises like Microsoft, Google, IBM and Facebook. These companies are leading many of the most popular projects like React and TensorFlow. Personally, I was lucky to be part of such a company, Wix.com, and help take it from a walled-garden to <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.freecodecamp.org%2Fthe-top-contributors-to-github-2017-be98ab854e87" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>number 11</a> in some obscure ranked list of global open source contributors in 2017.</p><p  class='text-p'>Why are these companies choosing to open parts of their IP? Well, it’s certainly not because of ideology. Open source is making these companies more competitive.</p><p  class='text-p'>A good example is Google with Android. Google was late to the coveted space of mobile already predominated by Apple with the transformative release of the iPhone. Microsoft was late as well (technically they were there first but with the wrong product), with more years of operating system domination than the other two combined. Penetrating this emerging market was no easy task.</p><p  class='text-p'>Part of Google’s strategy was relying on a largely open source operating system, Android. Manufacturers like Samsung would have otherwise found it hard to join — basing critical parts of their business on an ecosystem they have zero control over would be unwise. This strategy paid off. The Android ecosystem grew as the open answer to Apple’s closed garden. Google did forgo the ability to sell licenses for this property, but gained something much more valuable: presence in the pockets of over a quarter of the population of Earth.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/blockchain-as-the-next-evolutionary-step-of-the-open-source-movement/mobile-operating-system-marketshare-worldwide-2009-2019.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>The same debate is taking place today about blockchain. Why would for-profit companies, market leaders especially, ever opt to decentralize any part of their business? Isn’t their position of power linked to centralized control?</p><p  class='text-p'>I argue that they will do so for the same exact reason. Not because of ideology, but because it will make them more competitive. To maintain their positions of influence they will have to make ecosystems that are more open. Otherwise, their competitors will, and win.</p><h3 id="forks-control-and-the-balance-of-power"  class='title-h3'
    >Forks, control and the balance of power</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>We’ve seen why a company like Facebook would release IP like React — a project that transformed the way web frontend is built. What is less clear is why other companies would adopt Facebook’s native technology for their own critical-business paths.</p><p  class='text-p'>I was fortunate to have had a front row seat to such a decision. When I was at Wix.com there was a debate on whether to base the Wix.com website editor on React. For a company that creates websites for a living, risking the editor is risking the lifeline of the company as a whole.</p><p  class='text-p'>Imagine that one day Facebook decides to compete with Google for web domination and releases its own web browser as an alternative to Chrome. Significant parts of the web are based on React. What if, in this dystopian future, Facebook decides to make React incompatible with Chrome? This decision could jeopardize Wix.com’s business.</p><p  class='text-p'>The governance of open source is successful mainly due to the concept of forks. Anyone can take the entire source code of any open source project and make a copy that they control, at the click of a button. If Facebook would ever make React incompatible with Google Chrome, Wix.com can fork React and create a version that is compatible. If the community favors this fork to the one Facebook is maintaining, they would adopt it. At some point, the more popular fork would actually become “the” React in the eyes of the public.</p><p  class='text-p'>This delicate balance keeps Facebook in check. Facebook may maintain its position of influence as long as it doesn’t abuse it. Where does the line cross? where the consensus says it does.</p><p  class='text-p'>This sounds awfully close to how blockchain governance works. This same guarantee of the ability to fork is one of the core guarantees this technology provides to its users. One thing to notice is that this guarantee is much stronger under blockchain. Beyond the source code of the system, you can fork all of its data as well.</p><h3 id="a-continuation-of-the-open-source-movement"  class='title-h3'
    >A continuation of the open source movement</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>We’ve drawn several parallels between open source and blockchain. We’ve seen similar regard to both movements in their early days. We’ve seen similar motivations of openness. We’ve seen the same questions whether for-profit companies fit in. We’ve seen the same governance and balance of power.</p><p  class='text-p'>I argue that it’s more than mere coincidence. I see Blockchain as a continuation of the open source movement, picking up where this left off.</p><p  class='text-p'>There’s a clear limit to what can be shared with open source. Open source cannot open up live systems, it cannot open their data. You can share the source code for a server, but naturally you cannot share a running instance of this server.</p><p  class='text-p'>Blockchain is making this next step technologically possible.</p><h3 id="a-concrete-example"  class='title-h3'
    >A concrete example</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Let’s go back to Android. We’ve seen the value the ecosystem derives from having control of the operating system source code — this value allowed companies like Samsung to join in and made this ecosystem attractive.</p><p  class='text-p'>But Android is not just source code. There are many living services required for the ecosystem to function. Android relies on push notifications, it relies on payments, it relies on apps being downloaded from Google Play. These services are all running instances, not just code. Billions of users query them daily. They hold data.</p><p  class='text-p'>Who is running those services? Let’s focus on Google Play. With a name like that the answer is self evident. Google is running these services on private infrastructure that isn’t shared with anyone.</p><p  class='text-p'>What is the cost of having Google in sole control of Google Play? For starters, a 30% fee every developer pays Google for the benefit of distributing their app digitally. But that’s just money. Every mobile developer has felt the uneasiness with the app approval process. Less fortunate ones have experienced app rejection and the 3 strike suspension policy. Absolute control of a distribution channel where said company’s own products are being sold and distributed can’t be good for competition. See what’s going on with <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.spotify.com%2F2019-03-13%2Fconsumers-and-innovators-win-on-a-level-playing-field%2F" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Spotify</a> in the Apple store.</p><p  class='text-p'>What about competing app stores on Android? They’re possible, Amazon did a great job of building an alternative. Unfortunately these alternatives cannot resolve the fundamental problems and offer little differentiation.</p><p  class='text-p'>Being able to run a service like Google Play together would provide a great value to the Android ecosystem. Such an idea is not technically possible with open source alone.</p><p  class='text-p'>It is technically possible with blockchain though, I will be more than happy to show a proof of concept in one of my future posts. But let’s be honest, we won’t see this happening any time soon. A community run decentralized Google Play isn’t practical enough today primarily for business reasons.</p><p  class='text-p'>Instead, I see a different opportunity. An opportunity for a for-profit giant like Microsoft, desperate to carve some niche in the mobile space. Building an app distribution channel that is not completely centralized. Giving a few more guarantees to the developers who are relying on it. Not because of ideology, but because it will make the offering more competitive — more competitive than Google Play and Amazon Appstore at least.</p><h3 id="blockchain-will-become-mainstream"  class='title-h3'
    >Blockchain will become mainstream</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>I believe that history will show that every system that has multiple parties relying on it will eventually have to provide its users with some hard <a href="https://medium.com/@talkol/defining-the-public-blockchain-9aa0c08243d2" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>guarantees</a>. Not for ideology, but to remain competitive.</p><p  class='text-p'>This doesn’t mean that every system will run on blockchain. Just like every piece of software doesn’t have to be open source. But there is some critical part of the world that has to be open. Just like some critical parts of software must be open source for companies to be successful.</p></div></div></div><div class="single-blog-bottom"><h3 class="single-blog-bottom-title">Get involved</h3><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex flex-between"><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/logo.svg" alt="orbs logo"/><h4>White papers</h4><a href="../white-papers" target="_blank">Read the Orbs white papers</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/github.svg" alt="github icon"/><h4>GitHub Repo</h4><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network" target="_blank">Review the code &amp; contribute</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/documents.svg" alt="document icon"/><h4>Documentation</h4><a href="../white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians" target="_blank">Developer documentation</a></div></div></div></main><div class="subscribe" style="display:none"><section class="subscribe-overlay"></section><form class="subscribe-form form"><button type="button" class="form-close-btn" aria-label="Close"><img src="../assets/img/common/close.svg" alt="close"/></button><h3 class="form-title">SUBSCRIBE FOR UPDATES</h3><div class="form-content flex-column"><div class="form-success" style="background:#191919"><p  class='text-p'>Amazing!

    >Potential Difficulties</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Naturally, deploying CBDCs involves certain difficulties, especially during the transition phase. Therefore, all relevant authorities and government agencies must be attentive and responsive in order to effectively mitigate issues as they present themselves.</p><p  class='text-p'>Among the potential difficulties we foresee, we expect the impact on the banking industry to be the most significant. As briefly described in prior witings, banks to some extent might experience a liquidity challenge affecting their available credit reserves, thus making credit more expensive through higher interest rates. There could be several paths to alleviate this and increase cash reserves:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Generating new lines of business - The banking industry could undergo a major shakeup as new blockchain-based platforms are deployed, and many traditional (and highly profitable) services will no longer be provided by banks. It will challenge banks to redefine their role in the new economy and to adapt accordingly. While some banks probably see this as a threat, others could use this as an opportunity to grab substantial market share as the demand for new financial services grows. From the general public&#39;s perspective and even the central bank&#39;s, this spur in competition is positive, forcing banks to become more efficient overall.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Central banks are in control of the deposit discount rate, and are therefore in control of the demand for CBDC and for banks&#39; cash reserves. Therefore, the likeliest scenario is one where the central bank will set an interest rate (on CBDC reserves) to reach a new, improved and stable equilibrium. That equilibrium will see only a limited portion of banks&#39; cash reserves flow to CBDC deposits, not most of it and certainly not all of it. As with other similar kinds of economic stabilization measures, it may take some time for the market to readjust, but the market will reach a new and better state, given that the central bank is trusted by the commercial banks</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The role of central banks is to balance several responsibilities in order to maintain a reliable, growing financial market. Providing the option of opening a CBDC account with the central bank makes any person or entity a de facto customer of the central bank. No one actually intends to have them deal directly with the general public, rather they would essentially outsource this service to commercial banks, generating a new line of business and new stream of revenues</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The new CBDC deposit accounts will not be credit facilities. Those will only be provided by commercial banks. Thus banks will focus on offering their customers active financial services rather than just money storage</p></li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>There may be additional difficulties involved in the process of migrating to CBDC, however we will only discuss two more: user privacy and raising sufficient public awareness.</p><p  class='text-p'>Firstly, privacy and anonymity, especially in the context of payment services, will always be a point of contention. On the one hand, many want full domain over their privacy by having the option to use fully anonymous means of payment. On the other hand, such features might be exploited by nefarious actors for illegal activity and tax evasion. As previously noted, CBDCs may provide different levels of user privacy, depending on the central bank&#39;s policy. The most simple solution would be leaving only the lowest value banknotes available, while limiting the allowed value per cash transaction. That would make the transition towards a true cashless economy smoother and quicker. In certain countries, it may even allow policy makers a defense against critics, as not all cash has been abolished.</p><p  class='text-p'>Secondly, getting the public on board may present difficulties. Public awareness campaigns and proper education should mitigate this. We truly believe that any argument that certain parts of the population could not handle this transition and might be victims for potential fraud are patently absurd. Yes, there will be fraudsters and it will take longer for some to &quot;master&quot; the use of digital payments. However, this genuine concern is not reason enough to reject change outright. Had that been the case, there would have been no move to e-banking, internet or mobile devices. Can you imagine our world today without any of them?</p><h3 id="suggested-strategic-outline"  class='title-h3'
    >Suggested Strategic Outline</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In light of the above, and assuming that we have been able to persuade the reader that CBDCs are a powerful instrument that ought to be adopted by central banks, we suggest the following strategy, which calls for a centralized CBDC on a private blockchain protocol but which allows for development into a decentralized protocol - if the technology proves itself to be viable. Deployment would occur in three steps according to this strategy, spread over several years, but starting sooner rather than later. There is no point in indicating the length of each phase, which would be an open question, but we certainly expect a central bank to set reasonable targets on this roadmap and stick to that plan.</p><ol>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 1 - Introducing CBDC Light, for digital payments only. This currency is the light version of the later full-featured centralized CBDC. The general public may open reserve accounts at the central bank, but they will not carry interest and are intended to be used as the central bank&#39;s certified digital wallets. The goal is to introduce the advantages of using digital payment services and reduce the use of cash to a minimum, leaving only the lowest value bills in circulation. This period will allow commercial banks to start getting used to the idea of having a CBDC, knowing that a full-featured CBDC is waiting just around the corner.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 2 - Introducing a full-featured centralized CBDC. Once the public and commercial banks are accustomed to this lighter CBDC, the central bank upgrades it to a full-featured implementation in order to maximize its merits and utilize it as a full monetary instrument. This period involves potential disruptions to the economy, as discussed above. It is up to the central bank to manage the process carefully in order to drive the economy towards its new equilibrium, in which commercial banks are more efficient and generate new revenue streams. In parallel, the central bank during this time closely examines blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets in order to determine when it would be suitable to deploy a decentralized CBDC</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 3 - Discussing decentralization. As noted earlier, we are still not convinced that CBDC decentralization is necessary or ever will be. Still, we urge central banks to think about it, even if just to push the envelope as a thought-experiment, so that as technology advances, they will be in a position to decide if implementation is the correct strategy for them. We are certain that with time, new technology would provide better solutions to problems that we now cannot see being resolved. Central banks should focus their efforts on understanding several key topics which are critical to a decentralized protocol:</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What is the desired level of user privacy and anonymity?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Who are the participating nodes?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>How does the White chain operate?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What are the KYC &amp; AML procedures for opening an account on that chain?</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion"  class='title-h3'
    >Conclusion</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In this series of posts, we have provided a brief overview of CBDCs and why they should be implemented sooner rather than later. Since CBDCs are such a powerful instrument, their implementation must be calculated and methodical in order to maximize their merits and minimize their demerits.</p><p  class='text-p'>The roles and importance of major actors in our global economy are constantly questioned as we head towards a &#39;new economy&#39;. Each and every one of them will have to adapt to technological innovation in order to maintain relevance and in their position of maintaining market stability. The same goes for central banks. Being the economy&#39;s equivalent of the &quot;responsible adults&quot; in the room, they must engage.</p><p  class='text-p'>We support the recent trend of central banks experimenting and considering issuing a CBDC. In our view, central banks that are looking to lead rather than be led, cannot ignore the potential benefits of this opportunity nor the pitfalls of failing to follow what seems like an inevitable culmination of digital economic innovation over the last two decades.</p></div></div></div></ul></div><div class="footer-tweets"><section class="footer-section-title"><img
