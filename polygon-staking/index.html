    >Orbs Introduces Multi-chain Staking</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>TL;DR</p><ol>
<li>In November 2019, Orbs PoS V2: The Age of Guardians was launched, fully deploying the Orbs PoS architecture on the Ethereum network.</li>
<li>Since then, we have seen an explosion in usage on the Ethereum network caused by the emergence of DeFi and NFTs, which resulted in a substantial increase in ETH price and soaring gas prices for Orbs Delegators.</li>
<li>Polygon is a leading layer-2 scaling solution on top of Ethereum, facilitating high transaction throughput and low gas fees.</li>
<li>The Orbs team proposes utilizing Orbs hybrid architecture and cross-chain properties to deploy multi-chain Orbs PoS staking, starting with the Polygon network.</li>
</ol>
<p  class='text-p'>In this proposal, the Orbs team introduces a novel approach of multi-chain staking. This unique approach aims to utilize the solutions currently available in the crypto landscape to their fullest, in order to optimize the security and scalability of the Orbs protocol. This proposal is now made possible with the fruition of two main factors: Orbs becoming a multi-chain asset with integrations into all major chains, and the maturing of tested and functioning L2 solutions.</p><p  class='text-p'>After much research and deliberation, the Orbs team found Polygon as the most suitable chain to implement Orbs multi-chain staking. As of today, Polygon is the leading L2 project on top of Ethereum. Deploying Orbs staking on Polygon will capitalize on the advantages offered by the Ethereum stack, being the market leader by a large margin, and will help achieve both scalability and low fees as well as high security.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>The multi-chain staking solution proposed by the team is expected to completely mitigate the current high Ethereum gas costs for Orbs delegators interacting with the Orbs staking contracts.</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>Having the Orbs governance mechanism deployed on multiple chains is a revolutionary and bold move by the Orbs project which conforms with Orbs vision of interoperability across the crypto space. Orbs has always been at the forefront of blockchain technology innovation and the Orbs team is proud to put forward this proposal for the community.</p><h3 id="background-orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians"  class='title-h3'
    >Background: Orbs PoS V2 - The Age of Guardians</h3>
<p  class='text-p'><a href="https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs V2: The Age of Guardians</a>, launched in November 2019, introduced many significant upgrades to the Orbs protocol with emphasis on usage and performance. The main goal of Orbs V2 was to enable the Orbs Universe Guardians (validators) to take an active role in building and maintaining a secure, scalable network, which will be the first choice for blockchain adoption, and to better manage and serve the network and its participants.</p><p  class='text-p'>Fast-forwarding to the present, V2 was indeed a pivotal moment in the network&#39;s history, and was instrumental in turning Orbs into a functioning decentralized infrastructure protocol, with a set of committed Guardians and a strong backing community. The Orbs project is now stronger than ever!</p><p  class='text-p'>However, since November 2019, the crypto space, and ETH in particular, have also undergone some monumental shifts as a result of protocol upgrades and the emergence of new and exciting use-cases such as DeFi and NFTs. The fast-moving crypto market presents a sea of opportunities to projects who are willing to adapt and utilize these shifts to their advantage - and that is exactly what we are planning to do with this exciting new proposal by the Orbs team</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/polygon-staking/image1.png" alt="armor"></figure></p><h3 id="staking-on-ethereum-pros-and-cons"  class='title-h3'
    >Staking on Ethereum: Pros and Cons</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The Orbs project introduced a novel and original model of a hybrid blockchain:</p><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs network is based on its own blockchain that is used as an infrastructure for running applications. Orbs is therefore not a layer 2 for Ethereum and it holds its own value in its permissionless validator pool based on the PoS ecosystem of the ORBS token and its incentives model.</p><p  class='text-p'>However, the Orbs network’s hybrid architecture provides a role for another blockchain. The Orbs network currently utilizes the Ethereum network to host the ORBS ERC20 token and Proof-of-Stake contracts. As a result, the ORBS token is also used for staking, electing Guardians and rewarding the PoS participants. Orbs PoS Ethereum contracts implement the logic for staking tokens, electing the Guardians committee, distributing rewards and fees, and more. Orbs ecosystem participants, Delegators and Guardians, interact with the PoS contracts by sending Ethereum transactions to the relevant Orbs contracts, these transactions are subject to gas cost.</p><p  class='text-p'>The choice to delegate the voting functions to another blockchain was made because it provides an <a href="https://www.orbs.com/pos-external-oversight/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>external objective guarantee</a> that any observer can verify that elected nodes on Orbs are indeed the ones the stakeholders voted for. Similarly, launching the Orbs token as a token on another blockchain allows the Orbs token to enjoy the security benefits provided by the second blockchain’s security ecosystem. Ethereum was chosen as the second chain to provide these important functions, and is therefore a crucial component in the Orbs design.</p><p  class='text-p'>This structure allows the Orbs network to enjoy many of the benefits of both chains. However, the parts of the Orbs network that rely on Ethereum are still subject to some of Ethereum’s downsides - in particular high gas fees. High gas costs adversely affect some aspects of the Orbs Network operation, specifically transactions which are executed using Ethereum smart contracts, such as staking.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/polygon-staking/image2.png" alt="gas"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Since the V2 launch, Ethereum experienced an ever increasing trend of on-chain activity, largely due to the explosion in usage of DeFi and NFTs protocols. This in turn resulted in a significant spike in gas prices for using the Ethereum network. The Orbs team did take measures to mitigate this issue by launching various V2 <a href="https://www.orbs.com/v2-5-update-combating-the-gas-storms/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>protocol improvements</a>, mainly in the staking rewards assignment and distribution architecture, leading to an improved distribution mechanism and significant reduction in Guardians operating costs. However, the issue remained.</p><p  class='text-p'>With the introduction of <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/quorum/what-is-eip-1559-how-will-it-change-ethereum/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>EIP-1559</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/merge/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Ethereum merge</a>, as well as the long term belief in the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem, we expect this issue to persist. </p><h3 id="orbs-multi-chain-asset-amp-multi-chain-staking"  class='title-h3'
    >Orbs: Multi-chain Asset &amp; Multi-chain Staking</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Around one year ago, the Orbs core team shifted much of its focus to the DeFi space, as we believed that DeFi will emerge as the killer app of blockchain technology. And indeed, during this period we saw an explosion in DeFi protocols, accelerated by the maturing of layer-2 (L2) technology and the rapid emergence of quality L2 infrastructure scaling projects.</p><p  class='text-p'>During this past year, the Orbs project has strengthened its position as a multi-chain asset across the DeFi space. Orbs is already available on 5 major layer-1 (L1) chains: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Solana, with Avalanche being the latest addition. This in turn accelerated the integration of the Orbs ecosystem with over 17 major DeFi platforms (such as UniSwap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, Kyber Network, 1inch, Alpaca Finance, Beefy Finance, QuickSwap, DinoSwap, Raydium, Trader Joe, Pangolin, with more to come in the near future...).</p><p  class='text-p'>The availability of functioning L2 chains together with Orbs’ rapid expansion into multiple chains, paved the way for various exciting and innovative applications for the Orbs network that were not available before. These include Orbs as a <a href="https://www.orbs.com/How-Orbs-Hybrid-Architecture-Is-Becoming-a-Game-Changer-in-DeFi/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Layer 3 infrastructure</a> for DeFi applications. </p><p  class='text-p'>Now, these integrations also allow for the Orbs Network to diversify and add another blockchain to its hybrid architecture by implementing cross-chain staking! </p><p  class='text-p'>Instead of having the Orbs Token staking just on Ethereum, Delegators will have the option of being part of a parallel staking system on Polygon.  </p><h3 id="why-polygon-"  class='title-h3'
    >Why Polygon?</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>When considering the next steps for the Orbs ecosystem expansion, Polygon emerged as a leading candidate being one of the most interesting scaling solution projects being built on top of Ethereum.</p><p  class='text-p'>After doing a thorough <a href="https://www.orbs.com/orbs-ecosystem-expansion-whats-next/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>research</a> into Polygon’s technology, ecosystem, defi activity and on-chain fundamentals, Polygon was indeed chosen to be one of the first chains for Orbs expansion. Since then, this conviction has only strengthened, with Polygon emerging as the leader of L2 scaling infrastructure in the Ethereum stack.</p><p  class='text-p'>After going <a href="https://www.orbs.com/how-to-bridge-orbs-tokens-onto-the-polygon-network/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>live on Polygon</a> using the official Polygon bridge to Ethereum, the Orbs presence on Polygon has flourished following addition of the ORBS token to leading protocols such as <a href="https://www.orbs.com/orbs-is-now-live-on-quickswap/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>QuickSwap</a>, the largest DEX-AMM on polygon. As liquidity increased in the Orbs pools, Orbs was also added to leading vaults such as <a href="https://www.orbs.com/Orbs-Extinction-Pool-Launched-on-DinoSwap/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>DinoSwap</a> and <a href="https://www.orbs.com/Orbs-Added-to-KogeFarm-Vaults/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>KogeFarm</a>. All in all, the Orbs expansion into Polygon has been a success and Orbs maintains a strong presence on the Polygon network.</p><h3 id="staking-on-polygon-proposal-overview"  class='title-h3'
    >Staking on Polygon Proposal Overview</h3>
<p  class='text-p'><strong>Having Orbs PoS staking on Polygon means that the Orbs network utilizes the Ethereum stack to its fullest potential: The security of Ethereum as the base layer, and the scalability &amp; low fees of Polygon as L2.</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>Adding staking on Polygon will require deploying Orbs PoS contracts on the Polygon chain, as well as having additional contracts to verify the merge state from Ethereum and Polygon to determine the Elections Committee results. In addition, the Orbs team will need to update the Tetra staking wallet to be compatible with Polygon. The end result will allow Orbs Delegators to have the ability to choose between staking on Ethereum and staking on Polygon, based on their own personal preferences and considerations. </p><p  class='text-p'>Thanks to Orbs’ earlier integration with Polygon, Orbs token holders can easily migrate ORBS tokens between Ethereum and Polygon using cross-chain bridges such as the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/how-to-bridge-orbs-tokens-onto-the-polygon-network/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>official Polygon bridge</a>. In addition, existing ORBS liquidity pools on leading protocols on both chains, such as <a href="https://blog.orbsdefi.com/p/orbs-on-uniswap-and-whats-next" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Uniswap</a> and <a href="https://www.orbs.com/orbs-is-now-live-on-quickswap/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Quickswap</a>, will provide the necessary liquidity and allow Orbs token swaps on each chain.</p><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs Network is a community-based project and cannot succeed without the collective effort of all participants, including the Orbs development team, Guardians, users and token holders. Since the launch of Orbs V2 we have always been attentive to the important feedback from community members and have been analyzing various solutions. With the advancement of L2 solutions and after a lot of groundwork by the Orbs team, we are now ready to put forward this proposal.</p><h3 id="what-s-next-"  class='title-h3'
    >What’s Next…</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The Orbs team is currently working on the technical details on this proposal which will be presented to the community in due course. In parallel, we will initiate ongoing discussions with the Orbs Guardians and the Orbs community to present and review the various aspects of this proposal for notes and feedback.</p><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs team is extremely excited about this initiative which addresses one of the key feedbacks from the community following the V2 launch. Staking on Polygon will boost inclusion and participation of Orbs token holders in the PoS Universe staking, as well as solidify Orbs as a multi-chain protocol. In addition, the low fees on the Polygon network will enable the team to develop new features in the Orbs PoS Universe that are not practical on Ethereum, more on that soon…</p><p  class='text-p'>For a protocol to have a major part of its governance mechanism deployed on multiple chains is quite unprecedented.

    >Potential Difficulties</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Naturally, deploying CBDCs involves certain difficulties, especially during the transition phase. Therefore, all relevant authorities and government agencies must be attentive and responsive in order to effectively mitigate issues as they present themselves.</p><p  class='text-p'>Among the potential difficulties we foresee, we expect the impact on the banking industry to be the most significant. As briefly described in prior witings, banks to some extent might experience a liquidity challenge affecting their available credit reserves, thus making credit more expensive through higher interest rates. There could be several paths to alleviate this and increase cash reserves:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Generating new lines of business - The banking industry could undergo a major shakeup as new blockchain-based platforms are deployed, and many traditional (and highly profitable) services will no longer be provided by banks. It will challenge banks to redefine their role in the new economy and to adapt accordingly. While some banks probably see this as a threat, others could use this as an opportunity to grab substantial market share as the demand for new financial services grows. From the general public&#39;s perspective and even the central bank&#39;s, this spur in competition is positive, forcing banks to become more efficient overall.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Central banks are in control of the deposit discount rate, and are therefore in control of the demand for CBDC and for banks&#39; cash reserves. Therefore, the likeliest scenario is one where the central bank will set an interest rate (on CBDC reserves) to reach a new, improved and stable equilibrium. That equilibrium will see only a limited portion of banks&#39; cash reserves flow to CBDC deposits, not most of it and certainly not all of it. As with other similar kinds of economic stabilization measures, it may take some time for the market to readjust, but the market will reach a new and better state, given that the central bank is trusted by the commercial banks</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The role of central banks is to balance several responsibilities in order to maintain a reliable, growing financial market. Providing the option of opening a CBDC account with the central bank makes any person or entity a de facto customer of the central bank. No one actually intends to have them deal directly with the general public, rather they would essentially outsource this service to commercial banks, generating a new line of business and new stream of revenues</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The new CBDC deposit accounts will not be credit facilities. Those will only be provided by commercial banks. Thus banks will focus on offering their customers active financial services rather than just money storage</p></li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>There may be additional difficulties involved in the process of migrating to CBDC, however we will only discuss two more: user privacy and raising sufficient public awareness.</p><p  class='text-p'>Firstly, privacy and anonymity, especially in the context of payment services, will always be a point of contention. On the one hand, many want full domain over their privacy by having the option to use fully anonymous means of payment. On the other hand, such features might be exploited by nefarious actors for illegal activity and tax evasion. As previously noted, CBDCs may provide different levels of user privacy, depending on the central bank&#39;s policy. The most simple solution would be leaving only the lowest value banknotes available, while limiting the allowed value per cash transaction. That would make the transition towards a true cashless economy smoother and quicker. In certain countries, it may even allow policy makers a defense against critics, as not all cash has been abolished.</p><p  class='text-p'>Secondly, getting the public on board may present difficulties. Public awareness campaigns and proper education should mitigate this. We truly believe that any argument that certain parts of the population could not handle this transition and might be victims for potential fraud are patently absurd. Yes, there will be fraudsters and it will take longer for some to &quot;master&quot; the use of digital payments. However, this genuine concern is not reason enough to reject change outright. Had that been the case, there would have been no move to e-banking, internet or mobile devices. Can you imagine our world today without any of them?</p><h3 id="suggested-strategic-outline"  class='title-h3'
    >Suggested Strategic Outline</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In light of the above, and assuming that we have been able to persuade the reader that CBDCs are a powerful instrument that ought to be adopted by central banks, we suggest the following strategy, which calls for a centralized CBDC on a private blockchain protocol but which allows for development into a decentralized protocol - if the technology proves itself to be viable. Deployment would occur in three steps according to this strategy, spread over several years, but starting sooner rather than later. There is no point in indicating the length of each phase, which would be an open question, but we certainly expect a central bank to set reasonable targets on this roadmap and stick to that plan.</p><ol>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 1 - Introducing CBDC Light, for digital payments only. This currency is the light version of the later full-featured centralized CBDC. The general public may open reserve accounts at the central bank, but they will not carry interest and are intended to be used as the central bank&#39;s certified digital wallets. The goal is to introduce the advantages of using digital payment services and reduce the use of cash to a minimum, leaving only the lowest value bills in circulation. This period will allow commercial banks to start getting used to the idea of having a CBDC, knowing that a full-featured CBDC is waiting just around the corner.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 2 - Introducing a full-featured centralized CBDC. Once the public and commercial banks are accustomed to this lighter CBDC, the central bank upgrades it to a full-featured implementation in order to maximize its merits and utilize it as a full monetary instrument. This period involves potential disruptions to the economy, as discussed above. It is up to the central bank to manage the process carefully in order to drive the economy towards its new equilibrium, in which commercial banks are more efficient and generate new revenue streams. In parallel, the central bank during this time closely examines blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets in order to determine when it would be suitable to deploy a decentralized CBDC</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 3 - Discussing decentralization. As noted earlier, we are still not convinced that CBDC decentralization is necessary or ever will be. Still, we urge central banks to think about it, even if just to push the envelope as a thought-experiment, so that as technology advances, they will be in a position to decide if implementation is the correct strategy for them. We are certain that with time, new technology would provide better solutions to problems that we now cannot see being resolved. Central banks should focus their efforts on understanding several key topics which are critical to a decentralized protocol:</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What is the desired level of user privacy and anonymity?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Who are the participating nodes?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>How does the White chain operate?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What are the KYC &amp; AML procedures for opening an account on that chain?</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion"  class='title-h3'
    >Conclusion</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In this series of posts, we have provided a brief overview of CBDCs and why they should be implemented sooner rather than later. Since CBDCs are such a powerful instrument, their implementation must be calculated and methodical in order to maximize their merits and minimize their demerits.</p><p  class='text-p'>The roles and importance of major actors in our global economy are constantly questioned as we head towards a &#39;new economy&#39;. Each and every one of them will have to adapt to technological innovation in order to maintain relevance and in their position of maintaining market stability. The same goes for central banks. Being the economy&#39;s equivalent of the &quot;responsible adults&quot; in the room, they must engage.</p><p  class='text-p'>We support the recent trend of central banks experimenting and considering issuing a CBDC. In our view, central banks that are looking to lead rather than be led, cannot ignore the potential benefits of this opportunity nor the pitfalls of failing to follow what seems like an inevitable culmination of digital economic innovation over the last two decades.</p></div></div></div></ul></div><div class="footer-tweets"><section class="footer-section-title"><img
