If you wish to comment or clap, please visit the</em> <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper-899949ec555b" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>original publication here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p  class='text-p'>If you’re ever stranded on a deserted island, knowing how to run the process of <em>decentralized consensus</em> — or in other words, operate a very simple blockchain by hand — can prove to be very useful. All you need is some fellow survivors, this post, a pen and a few pieces of paper.</p><p  class='text-p'>If you’re not certain this skill is useful for your survival, be sure to read <a href="https://medium.com/@talkol/why-decentralized-consensus-blockchain-is-good-for-business-5ff263468210" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>my last post</a> on how blockchain can vastly improve island life.</p><p  class='text-p'>Let’s go back to that original story and go through the process with our fearless heroes, who just crashed on a deserted island somewhere in the South Pacific — <strong>Hugo</strong>, <strong>Sawyer</strong>, <strong>Kate</strong> and <strong>Jack</strong>.</p><p  class='text-p'>A short recap: the gang is trying to implement <em>IslandCoin</em>, a revolutionary new currency that will bring an end to the island’s crippled barter economy. The gang has agreed it’s fair if each of them starts with 100 coins. Since they don’t have metal to mint actual coins, they’ll have to make do with a few pieces of paper. Riddled with trust issues, the gang hasn’t been able to agree on one person to keep track of balances. Their only option is to maintain the balances <em>together</em>.</p><p  class='text-p'>We’ll start with what is probably the simplest blockchain implementation for our island use case. In future posts we can explore other implementations and tie them to concepts like <em>Proof of Work</em> and <em>Proof of Stake —</em> this will help us see their benefits and drawbacks. But for now, let’s start as simple as it gets.</p><p  class='text-p'>What are we trying to achieve? It’s very simple actually — all we’re trying to do is maintain a simple table of balances on a piece of paper. This table will show how many coins each of our heroes has. The trick is, because we can’t have <em>one</em> piece of paper that holds the only source of truth — we’re going to have to keep things equal and let each of the gang maintain their own version — this is the <em>decentralized</em> part. And naturally, we’re also going to hope that all 4 pieces of paper eventually show the same thing — this is the <em>consensus</em> part.</p><p  class='text-p'>So what would this piece of paper look like?</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*lcFfUboJfzFlgOKHj77QEg.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>This paper is the <em>first</em> one we agree on — that’s why it’s marked as day 1. Where did these balances come from? We’ve previously agreed it’s fair that each of the gang starts with 100 coins. We’re also going to need one of the survivors to write this paper. It doesn’t really matter who, so let’s take Hugo. He will be the one to publish this paper to everybody and make sure they each save a copy (the island has an amazing photocopy machine, I forgot to mention).</p><p  class='text-p'>Since coin balances are expected to change, we’re going to create a new updated piece of paper at the end of every day. It may not always be Hugo who publishes the update though — we want to keep things as fair as possible after all.</p><p  class='text-p'>Another important part, due to the lack of mutual trust in the group, is having each of the gang confirm the status update individually. An easy way to achieve this is having each one of the survivors sign each of the papers — but only if they agree with what’s written on it.</p><p  class='text-p'>How many people need to sign a paper for it to be considered final and approved? We need to reach <em>consensus</em>, so a majority will do. Since we have 4 people in total, a majority is at least 3 out of 4. The paper above was signed by all four so it’s definitely final. Why don’t we want to require all four signatures on all papers? Because this will allow one individual to jeopardize the entire process. If Sawyer goes on a fishing trip for a few days, the gang can’t update balances until he gets back — this gives one person too much power. Why do we even need a majority? Why isn’t 2 out of 4 signatures enough? Because if we only require 2 out of 4, we may end up with 2 people (like Hugo and Sawyer) signing one version of balances, and the other 2 people (Kate and Jack) signing a different version that doesn’t match. We can’t have two conflicting versions of reality both considered final.</p><p  class='text-p'>On the morning of the second day, Kate wants to buy a tomato. Hugo sells tomatoes for 2 coins each. She wants to transfer 2 coins to Hugo. Kate takes a new piece of paper and writes the transfer on it:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*RxkRElLi-s1bC3etoROohA.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>It’s Kate’s first action ever, so she labels it as such. In addition, Kate signs this paper. We have to have her signature to make sure nobody else can forge a transfer request on her account.</p><p  class='text-p'>The end of the second day is approaching and the gang wants to publish an updated set of balances. Hugo published the paper for the first day and collected everybody’s signatures. It makes sense to take turns doing so. The gang agrees to use a simple rotating order: Hugo, Sawyer, Kate, Jack, Hugo, Sawyer, and so forth. This means that publishing the status paper for day 2 is Sawyer’s responsibility. The paper he publishes reflects Kate’s transfer:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*k1OztwCQK0VCEj2q0lksuw.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>This paper that Sawyer made isn’t final yet because it’s only signed by Sawyer. He needs to collect more signatures. Sawyer goes through the gang and asks each one to verify and sign it. This paper is very easy to verify. First, the verifier needs to look in his own collection of papers and find the status paper that shows the balances for the previous day (day 1 in this case). Next, the verifier needs to go over the new list of transfers. In this case, we only have one transfer by Kate. This transfer is easy to verify, we can make sure it’s indeed signed by Kate and we can make sure Kate indeed has enough coins in her balance to give this amount to Hugo.</p><p  class='text-p'>Once every island inhabitant completes their verification process and signs the paper, Sawyer now has a final status paper for day 2 to publish to everybody. Everybody makes a copy and goes to sleep happy and content.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*Q5eXmxUT_ApsMmryyMW9EQ.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Day 3 is upon us. The system is working well and everybody is excited to spend their coins. Hugo wants to buy some firewood from Sawyer for 10 coins. Sawyer wants to get some pills from Jack for 25 coins and Jack is hungry for a tomato and wants to give Hugo 2 coins to buy one. They each create a piece of paper detailing their transfer:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*ycX4055SkQtlxdWD-8lUbA.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*bctWuCZFNwQQUUujmReiog.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*pp0Wt7y_zErceqjSajZlLQ.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>As evening approaches, the person publishing today’s balances is Kate. To make sure Kate includes these transfers in her paper proposal, they each need to give her a copy of their transfer request. It actually makes sense to give copies to everybody because the person wanting to perform a transfer doesn’t necessarily remember whose turn it is to publish today’s update.</p><p  class='text-p'>Jack lingers with getting the copy of his transfer request to Kate and by the time he brings it to her, her balance status of the day is already written:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*tBS7xHCuxj_23NZyHt-oBA.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Jack is frustrated that this balance status doesn’t include his own transfer. This means Hugo won’t receive Jack’s payment for the tomato, and won’t give Jack the tomato for dinner. Jack is going to go to sleep hungry tonight. He storms out to look for something else to eat and doesn’t sign Kate’s paper proposal for the day. Luckily, Kate is able to get enough signatures from the rest of the gang:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*ZmnafqZRmDwnG2zoymt17g.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Kate managed to get 3 signatures on the paper, each verifying that the balances indeed match the transfers and yesterday’s balances. We have a majority, so this status sheet is considered final.</p><p  class='text-p'>It’s day 4 and nobody knows where Jack is. He went fishing the night before, got caught out in a storm and didn’t return to camp. It might be problematic because it’s Jack’s turn today to publish the balance update.</p><p  class='text-p'>Kate wants to make a couple of transfers today, she writes them on a piece of paper and gives a copy to everybody:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*teHs2E8mXwau6ES-h0rwXw.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Evening approaches and Jack isn’t back yet. The gang had previously agreed that it’s his turn to publish the balances, but he’s nowhere to be found, so this day’s balance update is skipped.</p><p  class='text-p'>It’s day 5, and Hugo is the one responsible for publishing the daily update. It’s been raining for a few days and Hugo wants a warmer place to sleep. He asks Sawyer to build him a small wooden hut. Sawyer wants 200 coins for the job. It’s a bit of a problem because Hugo only has 98 coins. Hugo has a crazy idea though, he is the one publishing the balance sheet today, so why not add a crazy transfer of this amount to Sawyer anyways?</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*qP6qC5W3o5Cb5G5L6c9Hlg.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>There are no other transfers today. Hugo has Kate’s transfers from yesterday though, and Jack’s transfer from the day before that didn’t make it in eventually. He adds all of those, together with his new crazy transfer:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*J6AZfUSvAvINSQtWHy1Zpw.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Hugo signs this update although his transfer doesn’t really make sense. To make this status update final, he needs to collect 2 more signatures. When he approaches Sawyer and Kate, they notice that on the previous final balance sheet (from day 3), Hugo had 92 coins. How can he send 200 to Sawyer? They refuse to sign this balance sheet until he fixes this error and removes this invalid transfer. He reluctantly agrees and publishes a new balance sheet which is correct. They eventually sign it:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*U405dZX7lZmgSicmn8-EFA.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>This balance update is final because it has 3 signatures.</p><p  class='text-p'>It’s the morning of day 6. Jack finally comes back to camp. He had a rough couple of days with the storm and all. He wasn’t part of the discussions in the last two days and missed announcements of new transfers and publications of new balance updates. He’s actually unsure how many coins he has. He finds the first fellow survivor he sees and asks for the latest updates he missed. He is given the final update for day 5 and the approved update Kate that published on day 3.</p><p  class='text-p'>It’s easy for Jack to synchronize back with the rest of the gang. He can see that these balance updates were indeed signed at least 3 times, so he can be relatively safe that they’re ok. He can also perform the calculations himself based on these updates and the latest update he has (from day 2). This will allow Jack to participate in today’s transfers just like he didn’t miss anything.</p><p  class='text-p'>The system seems to be working well. It’s true that it’s a bit simplistic, but it’s enough for what these island inhabitants need. Well, we can’t have a functioning blockchain without a white paper! The gang sits down and celebrates the accomplishment by publishing this magnificent one:</p><p  class='text-p'>Why is this considered a blockchain? For starters, each piece of paper published daily represents a <em>block</em>. Each block is numbered and points to the previous one — forming a chain of blocks. In order to verify the current state of balances, any observer must start from the beginning of the chain (day 1 — the <em>genesis block</em>) and verify each of the blocks one after the other in succession. The balances are built incrementally.</p><p  class='text-p'>Is this an ideal blockchain implementation? Probably not. It can be improved in many ways. For example, it only supports these 4 inhabitants. What happens if another survivor crashes on the island? Will this protocol be able to accommodate them? This protocol is also currently <em>permissioned</em>, how can we turn it to be <em>permissionless</em>?

    >Potential Difficulties</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Naturally, deploying CBDCs involves certain difficulties, especially during the transition phase. Therefore, all relevant authorities and government agencies must be attentive and responsive in order to effectively mitigate issues as they present themselves.</p><p  class='text-p'>Among the potential difficulties we foresee, we expect the impact on the banking industry to be the most significant. As briefly described in prior witings, banks to some extent might experience a liquidity challenge affecting their available credit reserves, thus making credit more expensive through higher interest rates. There could be several paths to alleviate this and increase cash reserves:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Generating new lines of business - The banking industry could undergo a major shakeup as new blockchain-based platforms are deployed, and many traditional (and highly profitable) services will no longer be provided by banks. It will challenge banks to redefine their role in the new economy and to adapt accordingly. While some banks probably see this as a threat, others could use this as an opportunity to grab substantial market share as the demand for new financial services grows. From the general public&#39;s perspective and even the central bank&#39;s, this spur in competition is positive, forcing banks to become more efficient overall.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Central banks are in control of the deposit discount rate, and are therefore in control of the demand for CBDC and for banks&#39; cash reserves. Therefore, the likeliest scenario is one where the central bank will set an interest rate (on CBDC reserves) to reach a new, improved and stable equilibrium. That equilibrium will see only a limited portion of banks&#39; cash reserves flow to CBDC deposits, not most of it and certainly not all of it. As with other similar kinds of economic stabilization measures, it may take some time for the market to readjust, but the market will reach a new and better state, given that the central bank is trusted by the commercial banks</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The role of central banks is to balance several responsibilities in order to maintain a reliable, growing financial market. Providing the option of opening a CBDC account with the central bank makes any person or entity a de facto customer of the central bank. No one actually intends to have them deal directly with the general public, rather they would essentially outsource this service to commercial banks, generating a new line of business and new stream of revenues</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The new CBDC deposit accounts will not be credit facilities. Those will only be provided by commercial banks. Thus banks will focus on offering their customers active financial services rather than just money storage</p></li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>There may be additional difficulties involved in the process of migrating to CBDC, however we will only discuss two more: user privacy and raising sufficient public awareness.</p><p  class='text-p'>Firstly, privacy and anonymity, especially in the context of payment services, will always be a point of contention. On the one hand, many want full domain over their privacy by having the option to use fully anonymous means of payment. On the other hand, such features might be exploited by nefarious actors for illegal activity and tax evasion. As previously noted, CBDCs may provide different levels of user privacy, depending on the central bank&#39;s policy. The most simple solution would be leaving only the lowest value banknotes available, while limiting the allowed value per cash transaction. That would make the transition towards a true cashless economy smoother and quicker. In certain countries, it may even allow policy makers a defense against critics, as not all cash has been abolished.</p><p  class='text-p'>Secondly, getting the public on board may present difficulties. Public awareness campaigns and proper education should mitigate this. We truly believe that any argument that certain parts of the population could not handle this transition and might be victims for potential fraud are patently absurd. Yes, there will be fraudsters and it will take longer for some to &quot;master&quot; the use of digital payments. However, this genuine concern is not reason enough to reject change outright. Had that been the case, there would have been no move to e-banking, internet or mobile devices. Can you imagine our world today without any of them?</p><h3 id="suggested-strategic-outline"  class='title-h3'
    >Suggested Strategic Outline</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In light of the above, and assuming that we have been able to persuade the reader that CBDCs are a powerful instrument that ought to be adopted by central banks, we suggest the following strategy, which calls for a centralized CBDC on a private blockchain protocol but which allows for development into a decentralized protocol - if the technology proves itself to be viable. Deployment would occur in three steps according to this strategy, spread over several years, but starting sooner rather than later. There is no point in indicating the length of each phase, which would be an open question, but we certainly expect a central bank to set reasonable targets on this roadmap and stick to that plan.</p><ol>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 1 - Introducing CBDC Light, for digital payments only. This currency is the light version of the later full-featured centralized CBDC. The general public may open reserve accounts at the central bank, but they will not carry interest and are intended to be used as the central bank&#39;s certified digital wallets. The goal is to introduce the advantages of using digital payment services and reduce the use of cash to a minimum, leaving only the lowest value bills in circulation. This period will allow commercial banks to start getting used to the idea of having a CBDC, knowing that a full-featured CBDC is waiting just around the corner.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 2 - Introducing a full-featured centralized CBDC. Once the public and commercial banks are accustomed to this lighter CBDC, the central bank upgrades it to a full-featured implementation in order to maximize its merits and utilize it as a full monetary instrument. This period involves potential disruptions to the economy, as discussed above. It is up to the central bank to manage the process carefully in order to drive the economy towards its new equilibrium, in which commercial banks are more efficient and generate new revenue streams. In parallel, the central bank during this time closely examines blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets in order to determine when it would be suitable to deploy a decentralized CBDC</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 3 - Discussing decentralization. As noted earlier, we are still not convinced that CBDC decentralization is necessary or ever will be. Still, we urge central banks to think about it, even if just to push the envelope as a thought-experiment, so that as technology advances, they will be in a position to decide if implementation is the correct strategy for them. We are certain that with time, new technology would provide better solutions to problems that we now cannot see being resolved. Central banks should focus their efforts on understanding several key topics which are critical to a decentralized protocol:</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What is the desired level of user privacy and anonymity?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Who are the participating nodes?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>How does the White chain operate?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What are the KYC &amp; AML procedures for opening an account on that chain?</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion"  class='title-h3'
    >Conclusion</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In this series of posts, we have provided a brief overview of CBDCs and why they should be implemented sooner rather than later. Since CBDCs are such a powerful instrument, their implementation must be calculated and methodical in order to maximize their merits and minimize their demerits.</p><p  class='text-p'>The roles and importance of major actors in our global economy are constantly questioned as we head towards a &#39;new economy&#39;. Each and every one of them will have to adapt to technological innovation in order to maintain relevance and in their position of maintaining market stability. The same goes for central banks. Being the economy&#39;s equivalent of the &quot;responsible adults&quot; in the room, they must engage.</p><p  class='text-p'>We support the recent trend of central banks experimenting and considering issuing a CBDC. In our view, central banks that are looking to lead rather than be led, cannot ignore the potential benefits of this opportunity nor the pitfalls of failing to follow what seems like an inevitable culmination of digital economic innovation over the last two decades.</p></div></div></div></ul></div><div class="footer-tweets"><section class="footer-section-title"><img
