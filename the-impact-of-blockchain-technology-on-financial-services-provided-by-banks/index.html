    >The Importance of Banks</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Banks act as financial mediators and constitute a cornerstone of the modern economy. Originally, they were mainly providing liquidity. However, over the years their importance has amplified. Today, banks fill a critical role in various aspects: from financing companies and ventures to stabilizing market growth rates. There is no question that an advanced and efficient banking system is a prerequisite for a properly functioning economy. This paper focuses on the influence of blockchain technology on the financial services provided by commercial banks. These banks serve retail and corporate customers, providing them with a wide array of services:</p><ul>
<li>Account management: deposits, savings, investments, etc.</li>
<li>Credit services: lines of credit, international payment, letters of credit/documentary credit</li>
<li>Other financial services: foreign exchange, securities trading, trusteeship, custody</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>We believe that blockchain technology will be an important milestone in the evolution of the banking system, and indeed could be transformative to their business. It is clear to us that banks will have to continuously adapt in order to keep up with competition. In order to explain the potential impact of blockchain to the banking industry, we have chosen in this paper to review three exemplary financial services and explain the potential impact of blockchain on these services from a slightly different angle:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Payment services and Interbank Clearing</strong> – a common service, that is dramatically simplified using blockchain, and that is gradually being adopted by leading banks</li>
<li><strong>Cryptographic wallets</strong> – a new service that is still not provided by banks, but mostly by start-up companies, and that banks could start providing rather easily if they choose to</li>
<li><strong>KYC as-a-service</strong> – a brand new line of business not provided by anyone, and that is relying on one of the banks’ core competencies</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>It would be worthwhile mentioning that the last two of the above are among the largest obstacles for mass adoption of blockchain consumer use, and therefore hold immense potential for new business opportunities. It is also important to note that commercial banks fulfill another critical role in the national economy: increasing the money supply by granting credit within a reserve ratio as required by law. This aspect of their activity is beyond the scope of this paper. A quick review of blockchain and smart contracts before we delve into the nuances of their effect on the banking field:</p><h2 id="what-is-blockchain-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >What is Blockchain?</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Blockchain is an innovative technology that combines modern cryptography and decentralized systems. The fundamental difference between a centralized and a decentralized system is the manner in which decisions are made, for instance, when trying to update a database. While in a centralized system there is a single entity that is the sole responsible for decision-making, in a decentralized system a number of independent entities are required to collaborate. Neither has any information on the credibility of the others. Therefore, it is up to the protocol to decide whether a new input is reliable or not. This may be highly challenging when malicious entities are trying to compromise the system. To this end, blockchain protocols can verify whether new transactions conform with the rules agreed upon, even if the parties involved do not trust each other. For instance, Bitcoin is a blockchain network that allows bitcoin wallet owners to transfer payments, without a central authority that is in charge of clearing the transactions. According to this specific protocol, only private cryptographic key owners may execute transactions using their corresponding wallets. Transactions that are transmitted over the network are validated by network operators, AKA miners, who are entrusted with updating the distributed database, i.e. deciding which transactions are valid and updating wallet balances accordingly.</p><h2 id="smart-contracts"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Smart Contracts</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Nick Szabo, a renowned computer scientist and legal scholar, was the first to come up with this ingenious concept. If a computer had control of various assets (money, securities, writes of ownership, etc.) it would be possible to write program code in order to trade them. Put differently, it would be possible to create a legal contract, written as an executable computer code rather than as a text document. To the extent that the parties involved approve the code, i.e. the contract, and agree to its terms, they can sign it with their digital signatures. Such a contract is known as a smart contract, since a computer is executing the terms automatically. Many blockchain protocols allow writing smart contracts; in other words, running a computer code to execute changes in cryptographic assets, once their owners have digitally signed. With the above understanding in place, we can now begin to explain the impact these technologies will have on financial institutions:</p><h1 id="financial-services-analysis"  class='title-h1 title'

<h2 id="1-payment-services-and-interbank-clearing"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >1. Payment Services and Interbank Clearing</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>By “payment services” we refer to the execution of wire transfers in exchange for some sort of service, commodity, or other legal obligation. Whenever both ends of the transaction are not customers of the same bank, this service becomes more complex and involves multiple intermediaries. According to a 2016 World Bank report§, the overall volume of wire transfers made by retail customers in 2015 was estimated at $600B. A recent World Bank <a href="http://remittanceprices.worldbank.org" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>analysis</a> pegs the average fee for these sorts of payments at 7.13% of the amount transferred. ​</p><h3 id="the-current-payment-process-"  class='title-h3'
    >The Current Payment Process:</h3>
<p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/the-impact-of-blockchain-technology-on-financial-services-provided-by-banks/HX11.png" alt="The current banking process"></figure></p><ul>
<li>The payment originator, asks his bank, the paying bank, to wire money to a certain beneficiary, whose account is managed at a different bank. The paying bank initiates a KYC process and charges the associated fee</li>
<li>The paying bank then turns to the SWIFT network or any other correspondent bank to transfer the funds and to indicate the beneficiary bank</li>
<li>If the correspondent bank is connected directly to the beneficiary bank, it will transfer the funds. If not, the correspondent will look for another correspondent bank. This continues until a connection is established with the beneficiary bank</li>
<li>Once the beneficiary bank is notified by SWIFT or by the correspondent that the funds are on their way, it then notifies its customer, the beneficiary. It usually asks for some information about the source of these funds</li>
<li>Upon receiving sufficient information about the payment originator and the beneficiary, the beneficiary bank finally transfers the money to the beneficiary. When necessary, the bank may provide add-on services, such as currency exchange services</li>
<li>From time to time the beneficiary bank is required to report to relevant regulatory agencies about certain transfers that have been received, usually for AML purposes</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>​ § Migration and Remittance Factbook 2016 ​</p><h3 id="difficulties-during-this-process-"  class='title-h3'
    >Difficulties during this process:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Payment originator KYC process – this information-gathering process is for the most part manual and prone to human error. Furthermore, there are often difficulties in verifying the supporting documents provided by the payment originator as part of the this process</li>
<li>Use of the SWIFT network requires multiple fees and may take up to several days before a transaction is completed</li>
<li>The correspondent bank must always set aside sufficient liquid assets to back up and implement future transfers. This results in increased hedging costs and a loss of alternative income from these resources</li>
<li>Beneficiary KYC – the beneficiary bank, same as the paying bank, is prone to human error during the KYC process for its customer. These mistakes would likely face consequences with the relevant regulatory bodies come reporting time. Moreover, the bank is obliged to maintain dedicated reporting systems, whose only purpose is responding to potential requests by regulatory agencies</li>
<li>This entire process is manual, therefore, there is a higher probability of a human error during the data transfer, which might result in further delays</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="an-alternative-blockchain-based-process-"  class='title-h3'
    >An Alternative Blockchain-based Process:</h3>
<p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/the-impact-of-blockchain-technology-on-financial-services-provided-by-banks/HX21.png" alt="An Alternative Blockchain-based Process:"></figure></p><ul>
<li>The paying originator is identified by traditional procedures or via a digital identity registrar</li>
<li>The funds are transferred between the banks via smart contracts, reflecting the terms reached between the parties. As soon as both banks confirm their KYC, the transfer is <em><strong>immediately</strong></em> processed</li>
<li>Whenever a currency conversion is necessary, it can be carried out by a third party liquidity provider, chosen at an express tender</li>
<li>Once the smart contract is executed, the transaction is registered immutably on the blockchain. In addition, it is reported to the relevant regulatory agencies, allowing them to identify any suspicious or irregular transfers on an ongoing basis, without depending on periodic reports of banks</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages-of-the-alternative-process-"  class='title-h3'
    >Advantages of the Alternative Process:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Immediate transaction execution</li>
<li>Minimization of fees resulting in a reduction of intermediaries and a more efficient currency conversion mechanism</li>
<li>Improvement of government oversight efficiency, e.g. AML. Not only is there regulatory oversight at the time of the transaction, but also provides regulatory agencies with direct access to relevant information on all transactions</li>
<li>Automation enables reduction of manpower and minimizes human error</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary-"  class='title-h3'
    >Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Blockchain-based clearing platforms are already in use in leading banks around the world. Still, there are several obstacles to a widespread use of these solutions:<ul>
<li>Incompatibility of payment protocols with various AML aspects and user data privacy</li>
<li>As long as there are no sovereign states-issued cryptocurrencies, assets on these platform rely on privately-issued cryptocurrencies or IOUs</li>
<li>There is still no critical mass of banks using such platforms</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>In our opinion, these problems will be resolved in the next few years. We are in touch with a number of companies trying to resolve the first two of the problems listed above. In addition, we believe that it is a matter of time before central banks will also start using cryptocurrencies</p><ul>
<li>Blockchain-based transactions are likely to minimize the need for current interbank clearing solutions. Furthermore, these transactions will be documented on the network without a central entity (for example, SWIFT)</li>
<li>Blockchain technology should enable banks to execute wire transfers in real time, in a trustworthy and efficient process. This will most likely result in diminished commission incomes af first. However, in the long run it will increase the volume of transactions, including micropayments, so that overall banks may increase their income from this line of service</li>
<li>Blockchain technology will significantly reduce the risk of scams, given the improved user identity verification, as will be discussed in greater detail later on</li>
<li>Despite low transaction volumes, there are already two blockchain-backed clearing platforms in use:<ul>
<li>Ripple’s interbank clearing system provides a blockchain-based solution that is somewhat similar to SWIFT</li>
<li>Linq by NASDAQ is used for registering private securities transactions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It was only <a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-05-hsbc-ing-banks-blockchain.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>recently</a> that HSBC and ING announced the first use of blockchain to settle an international food shipment from Argentina to the United States. Likewise, ING and Credit Suisse <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/banking-finance/banks-dont-want-to-be-weakest-link-in-blockchain-revolution" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>reported</a> their first blockchain-based €25m bond-buying transaction</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-cryptographic-wallets"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >2. Cryptographic Wallets</h2>
<h3 id="the-status-quo-"  class='title-h3'
    >The Status Quo:</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Digital payments§ have grown significantly in the last few years. According to a <a href="https://on.bcg.com/2ELAUPm" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>report</a> by BCG, the global volume of digital payments is expected to reach five trillion USD by 2020. Banks and technology companies will have to invest large amounts of resources in order to support these expanding services. This growth will challenge banks who are already concerned with losing market share to non-bank financial services suppliers like Google, Apple, Facebook, Alibaba, PayPal, Amazon, or even Starbucks. However, the above is not the only – nor the most – serious of threats. There are at least two additional implied strategic threats:</p><ul>
<li>Banks will lose access to consumer data and purchase information, therefore will know a lot less about their customers</li>
<li>Payment services often constitute a gateway for building trust between banks and customers. Consuming these services outside the bank is bound to impair the bank-customer relationship, and might reduce the scope of other services provided by the bank</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>​ § In our context, a digital payment may be any sort of payment except for cash or credit card, e.g. mobile wallets, payment applications or payments via web browsers</p><h3 id="wallet-for-cryptocurrencies-"  class='title-h3'
    >Wallet for Cryptocurrencies:</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>We believe that the current level of accessibility and lack of ease of use for cryptographic wallets is one of the major impediments to their mass adoption, and is also holding back growth of the cryptocurrency markets. These wallets are very different from what most consumers are used to, as are many of the elements of blockchain technology. The result is mass reluctance. To get a better sense of the potential market, we suggest the following analysis:</p><ul>
<li>A recent <a href="https://bit.ly/2ElJKmR" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>estimate</a> counts about 26m unique§ cryptographic wallet users in the world, as of Q2 2018</li>
<li>A 2012 <a href="https://bit.ly/2Ch9RMT" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>estimate</a> counted about 2.1b credit cards in circulation worldwide</li>
<li>That same year, it was <a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-number-credit-cards-per-person" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>estimated</a> that the average American had 2 credit cards</li>
<li>Let us take the most conservative assumptions:<ul>
<li>The average global card holder is similar to the American one, <em>i.e.</em> holds two cards on average</li>
<li>The number of credit cards and card holders has remained constant in the years since the study</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Our conclusion would be that there are currently more than 1BN card holders worldwide. To put this number in perspective – it is 40 times the number of unique wallet owners. This means the potential for growth in user adoption is extremely large. ​ § In this regard, two wallets owned by the same person are counted as a single wallet</p><h3 id="existing-types-of-cryptographic-wallets-"  class='title-h3'
    >Existing Types of Cryptographic Wallets:</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Today, there is no definitive leader in crypto wallet management. Here are the main options available:</p><ul>
<li>Wallets without custody services – these include products like Trezor or Ledger Nano; or software like Jaxx, Electrum, and Exodus that require users to create a private key and protect that key by themselves. Use and operation of these wallets requires some degree of knowledge, but also provides the highest quality of security available</li>
<li>Wallet management via cryptocurrency exchanges – once registered for one of these exchanges, a wallet is created for each user. Access to the wallet only occurs via access to the exchange. Every exchange manages custody in conjunction with its own policies, without a single standard and in most cases without any official oversight. It is worth noting that even an exchanges do not provide any sort of security to user deposits. The sheer volume of large tokens that these entities hold make them constantly vulnerable to security threats. Therefore, it is currently inadvisable to store large amounts in these kinds of wallets. In 2014, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Mt. Gox</a> exchanged was hacked and attackers made off with 850,000 bitcoin§. This incident, like others afterwards, should serve as a warning sign to any user that sees these wallets as a permanent solution for cryptocurrency deposits</li>
<li>Mobile apps – there are several wallet apps available on Apple Store and Google Play. They purport to provide secure solutions, but most contain low-caliber security, often to the point of fraud. Generally, it is recommended to seldom use such apps, if at all</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>​ § At the time of this hack the bitcoins stoten were valued at $450m. as of writing this paper the total amount exceeds $5B</p><h3 id="summary-"  class='title-h3'
    >Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>We estimate that cryptocurrency wallet technology will improve dramatically over the next years. As a result, the user base will grow accordingly. Blockchain-based infrastructure is already capable of providing infrastructure to digital wallets. The main gap though remains user experience and a lack of consumer-facing solutions for securing or recovering lost cryptographic keys. This is still the main obstacle that makes current cryptographic wallets inferior in comparison to other centralized institutions</li>
<li>It is interesting to examine the evolution of web browsers as an analogy to cryptographic wallet: Both are gateways to a new and revolutionary technological infrastructure. In addition, using a browser in the early days of the internet required relatively advanced user skills and provided limited offerings. If wallet technology develops along a similar path, user experience will inevitably improve beyond recognition</li>
<li>As cryptographic wallet usage is expected to grow among consumers, one should assume enterprises will start using them as well. This is will drive accelerated development of more sophisticated wallet technology</li>
<li>In our opinion, it is inevitable that banks will offer cryptographic wallet services at some point. Though this may seem like a change in philosophy – a centralized body like a bank offering decentralized services that are likely to cut into the its own operations – however, this process may have positive implications both for banks and their customers:<ul>
<li>Banks would garner greater public trust than exchanges for safeguarding accounts. The expanded range of service packages to cover cryptocurrency wallets under bank supervision should reduce public anxiety about new products and technologies</li>
<li>Assuming the markets have huge potential, the first banks to offer such service bundles would be considered innovative, technological leaders. As leaders, they would have the opportunity to attract significant market share for new services and win over new customers for their “traditional” services as well</li>
<li>Even though cryptocurrency payment services run over a decentralized system, there are many other centralized add-on services that banks could still offer. Those might include deposit insurance, custody services, and more. If we assume that a certain proportion of the bank’s customers would migrate to using cryptographic wallets anyway, it is clearly preferable that it is done through a bank-offered service, even if only as an add-on</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-kyc-process"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >3. KYC Process</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>One of the critical tasks of banking operations is verifying the identity of their customers and the entities they are involved with. This is known as the KYC or Know Your Client process. Banks invest tremendous resources into this and constantly strive to improve the procedures. The essence of the process has hardly changed over the years and still requires manual collection and verification of customer credentials. At times, the inability to arrive at a sufficient degree of certainty regarding specific customers presents an obstacle to expanding the bank’s business. Furthermore, any failure in this regard would allow problematic customers slip through the cracks, hence increasing the bank’s overall risk level. Improving this process in a manner that keeps uncertainty to a minimum, would likely make the bank’s operations significantly more efficient while minimizing risk. ​</p><h3 id="current-process-"  class='title-h3'
    >Current Process:</h3>
<p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b5b6e2_bc7753e4ecad4749ba43837a24256689~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_682,h_368,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/current-kyc-process-compressor.webp" alt="current kyc process"></figure></p><ul>
<li>The customer provides credentials to any new bank that he/she wants to do business with, based on each bank’s unique best practices. There is always an overlap in terms of the requisite documents, still each bank has slightly different procedures</li>
<li>The bank verifies the customer’s credentials, and when necessary may even request for the assistance of relevant regulatory agencies</li>
<li>The customer repeats this entire process with each bank…</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="difficulties-with-current-kyc-process-"  class='title-h3'
    >Difficulties with Current KYC Process:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Banks conduct the entire KYC process by themselves and cannot rely on independent third parties to validate a customer’s credentials. In case a customer cannot provide the requisite credentials, the bank must take a risk and decide whether to proceed the onboarding or not</li>
<li>There may be certain situations where the bank requires a regulatory agency’s validation for a customer’s documents or credentials. Assuming that this customer has approached several banks and they all approach the regulatory agency, this duplication of referrals causes an unnecessary overload</li>
<li>Due to banking secrecy considerations, banks cannot share customer data or credentials with other banks. This means that each bank is forced to implement the KYC process redundantly</li>
<li>Due to customer privacy considerations, banks must secure customer data using countless IT platforms. Unwillingly, they have become enormous IT companies, investing invaluable resources in operations and maintenance of computing systems, instead of putting these resources to another use</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>​</p><h3 id="the-blockchain-based-alternative-for-kyc-"  class='title-h3'
    >The Blockchain-based Alternative for KYC:</h3>
<p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b5b6e2_7fe11fc1dbbf4fa78484d8dc9393e893~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_940,h_432,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/alternative-blockchain-payment-process-c.webp" alt="blockchain kyc process"></figure></p><ul>
<li>Customers upload prerequisite documents to the distributed ledger. They are the only ones who have full access to that information and control who they share it with</li>
<li>A regulatory agency may verify the documents shared with it. Once it does, the verification is immutable and could be used for any future KYC process</li>
<li>Whenever a customer approaches a bank, all it has to do is grant access to the relevant docs, that have already been approved by the regulatory agency</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>​</p><h3 id="advantages-"  class='title-h3'
    >Advantages:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Customers upload their documents only once. The information is saved securely on the decentralized ledger</li>
<li>When necessary, the regulatory agency verifies these credentials and personal information. The verification is secured both from a privacy perspective and data credibility</li>
<li>The bank does not bear any responsibility for the verification of the documents, as the it was the regulatory agency who has approved them</li>
<li>The bank is not required to store the document, since it already has access to the online decentralized ledger. As a result it no longer needs to operate and maintain redundant IT systems</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>​</p><h3 id="summary-"  class='title-h3'
    >Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Banks could benefit immensely from blockchain-based digital identity solutions. It may even turn out that they are the ones with the largest incentive to promote it</li>
<li>Improvement of the KYC process would be of great benefit to improving their efficiency from a number of perspectives:<ul>
<li>Improvement of customer service and KYC would improve customer experience</li>
<li>The possibility of automating these procedures in conjunction with the profitable reduction of human error, would practically result in the minimization of other risks (operational, regulatory, credit)</li>
<li>Reliance on credible information authenticated by an external, adept, and independent party</li>
<li>Improvement in the quality of customer data makes it possible to better adapt personal banking services according to individual customer needs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the example above, we discussed customer identification at length, however, banks could easily perform a similar process to verify identification of any other kind of assets, e.g. real estate, vehicle, etc. for the purpose of a more efficient lien management</li>
<li>It was <a href="https://www.synechron.com/news/39-firms-complete-global-trial-kyc-corda-blockchain-platform" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>reported</a> recently that 39 banks, among them are Societe Generale, BNP Paribas, the Federal Reserve of Boston, and ABN AMRO, launched trials of the Corda system for blockchain-based KYC. In these trials they were able to conduct 300 international transactions in four days, relying only this framework. Customers’ credentials have been successfully verified based on the alternative procedure described above</li>
<li>It is also worth noting Estonia’s state-sponsored digital identity projects. Following the implementation of the <a href="https://e-estonia.com/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>e-Estonia project</a> several years ago, it has become the most advanced sovereign authority to adopt digital identity. Estonia’s goal was the full digitalization of information on government servers, e.g. medical records, tax reports, assets, etc., and their storage over a blockchain network. This system enables Estonians citizens to do so. During the 2014 elections, it was even possible to cast ballots through this system. More countries are already looking into adopting these sorts of solutions. It would be safe to assume that adopting these systems will become increasingly common in the foreseeable future</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion"  class='title-h1 title'
    >Conclusion</h1>
<p  class='text-p'>Blockchain technology is still at its the early stages of having mass influence over our lives. It seems that throughout human history, whenever a new technology begins to gain momentum, a debate arises between evangelists and naysayers. There are those who try to use it to improve existing products and services, as well as skeptics who question its long-term viability and its potential. At this stage, it is still hard to evaluate just how influential blockchain technology will be on our lives. We believe that it will have an enormous influence and will almost certainly have a fundamental effect over systems that have hardly changed in decades. In this paper, we have tried to review a number of banking services that we think will improve due to blockchain technology. Whether the reader believes this technology heralds a revolution in banking or thinks its influence will be negligible, we recommend understanding its essence in order to form an independent opinion on how significant this change could be. Services such as identity verification, ownership restoration, estate management, anti-money laundering solutions, and others are hard to handle and crave disruption. One of the core competencies of a bank is the tangible and direct connection to its customers. New technologies that claim to disrupt current standards lack such a connection. There in which lies the potential of banks to adopt new technological solutions for existing challenges and to continue serving a central role in the new economy.</p><h2 id="additional-resources"  class='title-h2 sub-title'

    >Potential Difficulties</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Naturally, deploying CBDCs involves certain difficulties, especially during the transition phase. Therefore, all relevant authorities and government agencies must be attentive and responsive in order to effectively mitigate issues as they present themselves.</p><p  class='text-p'>Among the potential difficulties we foresee, we expect the impact on the banking industry to be the most significant. As briefly described in prior witings, banks to some extent might experience a liquidity challenge affecting their available credit reserves, thus making credit more expensive through higher interest rates. There could be several paths to alleviate this and increase cash reserves:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Generating new lines of business - The banking industry could undergo a major shakeup as new blockchain-based platforms are deployed, and many traditional (and highly profitable) services will no longer be provided by banks. It will challenge banks to redefine their role in the new economy and to adapt accordingly. While some banks probably see this as a threat, others could use this as an opportunity to grab substantial market share as the demand for new financial services grows. From the general public&#39;s perspective and even the central bank&#39;s, this spur in competition is positive, forcing banks to become more efficient overall.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Central banks are in control of the deposit discount rate, and are therefore in control of the demand for CBDC and for banks&#39; cash reserves. Therefore, the likeliest scenario is one where the central bank will set an interest rate (on CBDC reserves) to reach a new, improved and stable equilibrium. That equilibrium will see only a limited portion of banks&#39; cash reserves flow to CBDC deposits, not most of it and certainly not all of it. As with other similar kinds of economic stabilization measures, it may take some time for the market to readjust, but the market will reach a new and better state, given that the central bank is trusted by the commercial banks</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The role of central banks is to balance several responsibilities in order to maintain a reliable, growing financial market. Providing the option of opening a CBDC account with the central bank makes any person or entity a de facto customer of the central bank. No one actually intends to have them deal directly with the general public, rather they would essentially outsource this service to commercial banks, generating a new line of business and new stream of revenues</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The new CBDC deposit accounts will not be credit facilities. Those will only be provided by commercial banks. Thus banks will focus on offering their customers active financial services rather than just money storage</p></li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>There may be additional difficulties involved in the process of migrating to CBDC, however we will only discuss two more: user privacy and raising sufficient public awareness.</p><p  class='text-p'>Firstly, privacy and anonymity, especially in the context of payment services, will always be a point of contention. On the one hand, many want full domain over their privacy by having the option to use fully anonymous means of payment. On the other hand, such features might be exploited by nefarious actors for illegal activity and tax evasion. As previously noted, CBDCs may provide different levels of user privacy, depending on the central bank&#39;s policy. The most simple solution would be leaving only the lowest value banknotes available, while limiting the allowed value per cash transaction. That would make the transition towards a true cashless economy smoother and quicker. In certain countries, it may even allow policy makers a defense against critics, as not all cash has been abolished.</p><p  class='text-p'>Secondly, getting the public on board may present difficulties. Public awareness campaigns and proper education should mitigate this. We truly believe that any argument that certain parts of the population could not handle this transition and might be victims for potential fraud are patently absurd. Yes, there will be fraudsters and it will take longer for some to &quot;master&quot; the use of digital payments. However, this genuine concern is not reason enough to reject change outright. Had that been the case, there would have been no move to e-banking, internet or mobile devices. Can you imagine our world today without any of them?</p><h3 id="suggested-strategic-outline"  class='title-h3'
    >Suggested Strategic Outline</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In light of the above, and assuming that we have been able to persuade the reader that CBDCs are a powerful instrument that ought to be adopted by central banks, we suggest the following strategy, which calls for a centralized CBDC on a private blockchain protocol but which allows for development into a decentralized protocol - if the technology proves itself to be viable. Deployment would occur in three steps according to this strategy, spread over several years, but starting sooner rather than later. There is no point in indicating the length of each phase, which would be an open question, but we certainly expect a central bank to set reasonable targets on this roadmap and stick to that plan.</p><ol>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 1 - Introducing CBDC Light, for digital payments only. This currency is the light version of the later full-featured centralized CBDC. The general public may open reserve accounts at the central bank, but they will not carry interest and are intended to be used as the central bank&#39;s certified digital wallets. The goal is to introduce the advantages of using digital payment services and reduce the use of cash to a minimum, leaving only the lowest value bills in circulation. This period will allow commercial banks to start getting used to the idea of having a CBDC, knowing that a full-featured CBDC is waiting just around the corner.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 2 - Introducing a full-featured centralized CBDC. Once the public and commercial banks are accustomed to this lighter CBDC, the central bank upgrades it to a full-featured implementation in order to maximize its merits and utilize it as a full monetary instrument. This period involves potential disruptions to the economy, as discussed above. It is up to the central bank to manage the process carefully in order to drive the economy towards its new equilibrium, in which commercial banks are more efficient and generate new revenue streams. In parallel, the central bank during this time closely examines blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets in order to determine when it would be suitable to deploy a decentralized CBDC</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 3 - Discussing decentralization. As noted earlier, we are still not convinced that CBDC decentralization is necessary or ever will be. Still, we urge central banks to think about it, even if just to push the envelope as a thought-experiment, so that as technology advances, they will be in a position to decide if implementation is the correct strategy for them. We are certain that with time, new technology would provide better solutions to problems that we now cannot see being resolved. Central banks should focus their efforts on understanding several key topics which are critical to a decentralized protocol:</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What is the desired level of user privacy and anonymity?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Who are the participating nodes?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>How does the White chain operate?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What are the KYC &amp; AML procedures for opening an account on that chain?</p></li>
</ol>

    >Conclusion</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In this series of posts, we have provided a brief overview of CBDCs and why they should be implemented sooner rather than later. Since CBDCs are such a powerful instrument, their implementation must be calculated and methodical in order to maximize their merits and minimize their demerits.</p><p  class='text-p'>The roles and importance of major actors in our global economy are constantly questioned as we head towards a &#39;new economy&#39;. Each and every one of them will have to adapt to technological innovation in order to maintain relevance and in their position of maintaining market stability. The same goes for central banks. Being the economy&#39;s equivalent of the &quot;responsible adults&quot; in the room, they must engage.</p><p  class='text-p'>We support the recent trend of central banks experimenting and considering issuing a CBDC. In our view, central banks that are looking to lead rather than be led, cannot ignore the potential benefits of this opportunity nor the pitfalls of failing to follow what seems like an inevitable culmination of digital economic innovation over the last two decades.</p></div></div></div></ul></div><div class="footer-tweets"><section class="footer-section-title"><img
