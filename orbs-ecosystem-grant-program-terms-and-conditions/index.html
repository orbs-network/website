<li><p  class='text-p'><strong>Grant Programs and Purpose.</strong></p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The Program is aimed to fund research, development of open-source software, education and community engagement, supporting the growth of a vibrant ecosystem by providing applicants with grants in the form of fiat money, BTC, ETH, Orbs Tokens or such other form of consideration as the Company may select from time to time (&quot;Grants&quot;).</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The Company&#39;s Grant-making philosophy and funding programs revolves around its mission to build a truly decentralised, open-source ecosystem and developer community around the Orbs Network. The Company is interesting in receiving applications from interested parties who believe they have a proposal that can advance blockchain technology or add value to the Orbs Network (&quot;Applicants&quot;).</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>All Grants given to accepted Applicants (each, an &quot;Awardee&quot;) are subject to the completion of any prescribed deliverables, restrictions or other conditions as indicated in a definitive document such as a final endorsed Grant Award Letter issued to an Awardee.

This development follows successful integrations with other prominent DEXs including QuickSwap, SpookySwap, Thena, and more. With each integration, dLIMIT and dTWAP further solidify Orbs&#39; position as a market leader in DeFi innovation, showcasing Orbs&#39; novel <a href="https://www.orbs.com/overview/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>layer 3 technology</a> for pushing the boundaries of smart contract technology.</p><p  class='text-p'>dLIMIT and dTWAP are fully decentralized, permissionless, and composable DeFi protocols developed by the Orbs project and powered by the Orbs network. ArbiDex traders will now have access to the advanced order types at no extra cost, with dLimit enabling limit orders for single transactions and dTWAP enabling the execution of commonly used algorithmic trading strategies, all in a decentralized manner that was not available before.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://www.orbs.com/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs</a> is a decentralized protocol executed by a public network of permissionless validators using PoS, staked with TVL valued at over a hundred million dollars. Orbs pioneers the concept of L3 infrastructure, by utilizing the Orbs decentralized network to enhance the capabilities of existing EVM smart contracts, opening up a whole new spectrum of possibilities for Web 3.0, DeFi, NFTs, and GameFi.</p><h3 id="trade-defi-like-a-pro"  class='title-h3'
    >Trade DeFi like a Pro</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In the past month, ArbiDex supported a transaction volume of over 7 million dollars at the time of writing. dLIMIT &amp; dTWAP will expand the DEX&#39;s current offerings, potentially opening up another avenue for the project to increase trading volumes.</p><p  class='text-p'>For those who are unfamiliar, a Limit order allows users to buy or sell tokens at a specific price or better. While the specified price is guaranteed, the execution of the order is not and depends on price movement. Limit orders will only be executed if the market price meets the order specifications.</p><p  class='text-p'>In contrast, a TWAP order is an algorithmic trading strategy that aims to reduce the impact of large orders on the market by breaking them down into smaller portions that are then executed over time. By executing smaller orders, this approach lessens the price impact or enables traders to gradually acquire various assets over a specific period. In DeFi this is particularly useful as pools need time to rebalance.</p><p  class='text-p'>ArbiDex&#39;s traders can now utilize both of these key traditional finance orders without sacrificing decentralization.</p><h3 id="setting-up-a-dlimit-and-dtwap-orders"  class='title-h3'
    >Setting up a dLIMIT and dTWAP orders</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>When switching to a dLIMIT &#39;swap&#39; on ArbiDex, users are presented with an easy-to-follow user interface alongside an order history tab to keep track of previous transactions.</p><p  class='text-p'>Before executing a dLIMIT order, traders must specify the following:</p><ol>
<li><p  class='text-p'>From: The token that they currently have</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>To: The token that they wish to swap for</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Limit price: Trades will ONLY be executed when the available market price is equal to or better than the Limit price.</p></li>
</ol>
<p  class='text-p'>dLIMIT takes into account current market conditions, prices, and gas fees. Once the parameters are set, the user can approve the specific source token, place the order, and review their order live in the &#39;order history&#39; tab.</p><p  class='text-p'>For a dTWAP order, three additional parameters need to be specified:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'>No. of Intervals: allows the user to specify the number of individual trades. The UI automatically calculates the total number of transactions required to complete the entire order and the estimated trading interval.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Max Duration: the maximum time during which the total amount of individual trades making up the full dTWAP order may be executed.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Trade Interval: sets the time gap between each individual trade. The user can edit this parameter, which also results in changes to the corresponding trade size and number parameters.</p></li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Similarly to dLIMIT, these parameters provide incredible flexibility in customizing each order, taking into account factors like market conditions and current gas fees. Additionally, the UI facilitates both dTWAP-market orders, which execute all trades at the available market price, and dTWAP-Limit orders, which only execute individual trades if they are within the price Limit set by the user. Once these parameters are set, the user can approve the specific source token, place the order, and confirm their specified configuration.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/arbidex-integrates-dlimit-dtwap-powered-by-orbs/img1.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Redefining Trading Standards on Decentralized Exchanges</p><p  class='text-p'>The dLIMIT &amp; dTWAP protocols, powered by <a href="https://www.orbs.com/overview/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs L3 technology</a>, have become the industry standard for decentralized algorithmic orders in DeFi.</p><p  class='text-p'>To date, the protocol has been implemented by 8 prominent DEXs spanning 5 chains, facilitating over 5 million dollars in trading volume.</p><p  class='text-p'>For more information regarding both advanced order types, join the support <a href="https://t.me/dTWAPSupportGroup" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Telegram channel</a>.</p><p  class='text-p'>Find out more info:</p><ul>

Among other things, the ORBS token has been listed on over 20 exchanges, including venues like Binance and Bybit. This has helped the community grow. As the Orbs community has grown, so has interest in participating in staking. The Orbs project is decentralized and community-based, valuing community and core web3 values.   One way to solidify the long-term engagement of new community members is to encourage them to take an active part in the work of securing and operating the Orbs Network&#39;s technology by participating in the Orbs Proof-of-Stake Universe. To welcome and encourage new community members to participate, the Orbs community approved a governance vote to introduce the Orbs triple APY event for new stake.</p><h3 id="event-details"  class='title-h3'
