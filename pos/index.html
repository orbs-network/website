Therefore, when a Guardian operates a validator node and signs a block, it is backed not just by the Guardian’s own stake, but also by the stake delegated to him. The delegated stake significantly increases the amount of stake that backs the network security and therefore increases applications&#39; trust in its operation. Moreover, the delegated stake plays an important role in preventing network attacks. An attacker that wishes to gain control of the network for a short period of time and act maliciously will need to possess more stake than the current network Guardians and their community in order to be elected.</p></section></div><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-more-btn">+ Read More</button><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-less-btn">- Read Less</button></div></div><div class="expending-box expending-box-border-top" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="expending-box-content"><h4 class="expending-box-title">Rewards Assignment and Distribution Architecture</h4><div class="expending-box-text"><section class="expending-box-text-full"><p  class='text-p'>The Guardians are the key players responsible for network security and operation. Guardians are expected to build a community of Delegators that trust them to truthfully represent their and the network’s interests.</p></section><section class="expending-box-text-more"><p  class='text-p'>Providing the Guardians with the ability to set the level of rewards that will be distributed to their respective Delegators tightens their relationships with their communities. Staking rewards are set by the Guardians, who determine how to split the rewards amongst their Delegators, while a minimum rate of compensation to Guardians is imposed by the protocol.</p><p  class='text-p'>Guardians play an important role in the reward distribution process. In V2, an automated mechanism to set the level of rewards that will be distributed to their Delegators was enabled at the protocol level and featured as part of the updated Guardian interface. The mechanism calculates the amount of rewards that each of the Guardian’s Delegators is entitled to, based on the Delegators’ stake over time and the allocated ratio. An annual reward equal to 10% of total delegated stake is awarded, addressing the tradeoff between an appealing award and sustainable inflation (see Rewards). 1⁄3 of the rewards are guaranteed to the Guardians (i.e., 3.33% for a full year of staking), while the default values for the distribution application grant the remaining 2⁄3 to Delegators (i.e., 6.66% annual reward maximum). The new automated tool allows the Guardians to modify the Delegators’ rewards split.</p><p  class='text-p'>This optimized reward distribution architecture provides a scalable and gas-efficient reward distribution that occurs through the protocol itself. Under this system, once the level of distributions is set by the Guardians, the respective rewards are distributed by the protocol directly to both the Guardians and the Delegators, on a continuous basis. Delegators and Guardians can then decide when they wish to claim their reward tokens.</p><p  class='text-p'>This has multiple important benefits such as added flexibility to the Guardians and Delegators, who may claim the staking rewards at any point in time, significant reduction in costs for Guardians, and more.</p><p  class='text-p'>To learn more about the distribution mechanism, read the documentation​ on <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>GitHub</a>.</p></section></div><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-more-btn">+ Read More</button><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-less-btn">- Read Less</button></div></div><div class="expending-box expending-box-border-top" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="expending-box-content"><h4 class="expending-box-title">PoS on Ethereum</h4><div class="expending-box-text"><section class="expending-box-text-full"><p  class='text-p'>Being a hybrid Blockchain, Orbs has always been able to utilize the benefits of both the Orbs PoS architecture along with the benefits of Ethereum - an external objective blockchain for the PoS logic.</p></section><section class="expending-box-text-more"><p  class='text-p'>ORBS token, staking, delegation and voting already operated during V1  over Ethereum contracts, utilizing Ethereum’s value as an objective auditor. In V2, the Orbs platform’s architecture was updated to run the core of the election logic on Ethereum. The entire election logic, reward calculation and distribution are carried out using Ethereum contracts, providing multiple advantages. </p><p  class='text-p'>First, it provides a high level of transparency, in particular to light clients. Orbs clients rely on the elected set of validators as the foundation on which applications’ data correctness is based. The ability of any application running on top of Orbs to validate the elected validators set by a simple light client, with no need to constantly audit the election process and PoS logic, is of high value to business applications.</p><p  class='text-p'>Second, as the token, the subscription payments and the staking are performed on Ethereum, a valid state of the elected validator nodes set on Ethereum is required for full automation of Orbs fees and rewards distribution.</p><p  class='text-p'>Third, the PoS over PoW architecture provides additional security to the network. The use of two networks allows the Orbs Network to enjoy the aggregate protection of the combined networks, as any attacker would be required to incur the costs of attacking them both. Specifically, using Ethereum, which has a robust ecosystem whose participants are, in large part, impartial regarding what happens on the Orbs Network, makes it difficult for an attacker to exploit Ethereum to launch an attack on Orbs. The security advantages of this architecture manifest in a variety of ways. For example, it provides a measure against long-range attacks, in which the attacker creates an alternative chain starting with the same genesis block that is indistinguishable from the valid chain, and then misleading users to use the malicious chain. PoS architectures are susceptible to long-range attacks because there is no extra cost to creating long chains, unlike in PoW chains, where creating a long malicious chain would involve intensive computational resources. Thus, PoS typically requires applications to audit all the network traffic in order to validate the current PoS state. Orbs’ architecture avoids this problem by taking advantage of the security provided by Ethereum.</p><p  class='text-p'>Finally, the use of this hybrid architecture ensures the integrity of elections on Orbs, since the Orbs Guardians are not entrusted to process their own election. Processing the elections on the Ethereum network provides an external guarantee that the Orbs Guardians cannot manipulate the election process.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="../Polygon-tech" rel="noopener">Orbs V3: Multi-chain Staking</a>, expanded the Orbs PoS Universe to Polygon, utilizing the Ethereum stack to its fullest potential: The security of Ethereum as the base layer, and the scalability &amp; low fees of Polygon as L2. </p><p  class='text-p'>As part of PoS V3, the full suite of <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-ethereum-contracts-v2" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs PoS Solidity contracts</a> have been deployed to Polygon mainnet. This includes the Orbs Staking Contract, the contract calculating delegations and emitting committee results and the contract distributing staking rewards.</p><p  class='text-p'>As a result, <strong>Guardians</strong> are now able to support both networks and receive delegations on both Ethereum and Polygon. Similarly, <strong>Delegators</strong> can decide on which network they want to stake their tokens - Ethereum or Polygon (or both). Since the existing Ethereum mainnet smart contracts remain intact, ORBS can still be staked on Ethereum like before. Both networks pay the same staking rewards and have the same unstaking cooldown period, but gas is cheaper on Polygon so all actions on Polygon will require a fraction of the cost in fees.</p></section></div><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-more-btn">+ Read More</button><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-less-btn">- Read Less</button></div></div><div class="expending-box expending-box-border-top" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="expending-box-content"><h4 class="expending-box-title">Election Committee</h4><div class="expending-box-text"><section class="expending-box-text-full"><p  class='text-p'>Orbs’ architecture deploys a hybrid model of two committees: General and Certified.

It comprises the top 22 Guardians with the most delegated stake, whether they have been certified or not.

The Certified committee provides a suitable solution for developers with regulatory restrictions that are interested in running applications on a blockchain. Developers may also choose initially to use the Certified committee to reduce friction and transition to the General committee over time.</p></section></div><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-more-btn">+ Read More</button><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-less-btn">- Read Less</button></div></div><div class="expending-box expending-box-border-top" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="expending-box-content"><h4 class="expending-box-title">Rewards, Fees &amp; Bootstrap Fund</h4><div class="expending-box-text"><section class="expending-box-text-full"><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs incentive layer is built to incentivize a maximum overlap between the two committees. A high overlap implies a higher stake backing each committee. Guardians are incentivized to meet the certification requirements and earn additional rewards associated with participation in the certified committee. Certified Guardians are incentivized to accumulate a high stake to enjoy the rewards of the General committee.</p></section><section class="expending-box-text-more"><p  class='text-p'>The fees and rewards in the Orbs PoS architecture serve two important purposes. The first is compensation for operating a validator node. The second is a reward for contributing to network security by staking. The reward model is targeted to award the ones who deserve it - participants that contribute to the network operation and security.</p><p  class='text-p'>Operating a validator node has a cost that includes both computational resources cost and operations cost. Two forms of compensation are designed to cover these costs. First, Virtual Chain fees are paid in the form of Orbs Tokens by the network users who launch a virtual chain. The fees paid for each Virtual Chain are expected to represent the cost with a profit margin. As the network matures and runs more Virtual Chains, the cost per Virtual Chain is expected to be almost constant, representing the cost of the computational resources allocated to the Virtual Chain.</p><p  class='text-p'>This suggests a scalable solution, as the Guardians’ rewards increase as the usage increases.</p><p  class='text-p'>In order to incentivize Guardians to participate in the Certified committee by covering their costs, we included an additional bootstrap fund for Guardians who join the Certified committee. This fund is distributed in DAI, pegged to USD, popular in many DeFi applications. It provides profitability even if the token value fluctuates. Furthermore the fund is designed to cover the cost of operating a validator node while running a small number of Virtual Chains during the network early stages. This is important as it provides developers with the ease of mind that the network will continue to operate even under unexpected price fluctuations.</p><p  class='text-p'>A Guardian that operates a validator node and goes through the certification process to participate in the Certified committee will be entitled to receive the annual total of 3000 DAI. This fund provides an incentive for Guardians to participate in the Certified committee, thus increasing the participating stake in this committee and making the network more attractive to app users, while covering the reduced cost of operation as further described in the next episode.</p><p  class='text-p'>Virtual Chain fees and the bootstrap fund are awarded for the operation of validator nodes by Guardians. Therefore, unlike staking rewards, the fees and the bootstrap fund are distributed directly to the Guardians operating the validator nodes. The fees and the bootstrap fund are not staked or shared with the Delegators, allowing the Guardians to utilize them to cover their costs. The fees and the bootstrap fund are awarded for the time period that a Guardian participates in the applicable committee. Once awarded, the rewards can be claimed by the Guardian at any time.</p><p  class='text-p'>Staking rewards are awarded for the stake that elected Guardians and their Delegators allocate to contribute to the network security. It is important to note that <strong>​Only the top 22 elected Guardians are eligible for the rewards, fees and bootstrap funds</strong>.</p><p  class='text-p'>An annual reward equal to 10% of total delegated stake is awarded, addressing the tradeoff between an appealing award and sustainable inflation. 1⁄3 of the rewards are guaranteed to the Guardians (i.e., 3.33% annual reward for a full year of staking), while the default values for the distribution application grant the remaining 2⁄3 to Delegators (i.e., up to 6.66% annual reward maximum).</p></section></div><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-more-btn">+ Read More</button><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-less-btn">- Read Less</button></div></div><div class="expending-box expending-box-border-top" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="expending-box-content"><h4 class="expending-box-title">Validator Nodes Streamlining</h4><div class="expending-box-text"><section class="expending-box-text-full"><p  class='text-p'>Orbs PoS Universe V2.5 significantly reduced the cost of operating and maintaining a validator node on the Orbs Network.

Therefore, it is the role of the Orbs Delegators to actively contribute to the network’s success by staking their ORBS tokens.</p></section><section class="expending-box-text-more"><p  class='text-p'>Orbs’ ​Locking Mechanism​ (providing a 14-day cool-down period for unstaking) enhances the stability and security of the Orbs Network. In addition, the Orbs team developed TETRA​, a dedicated staking wallet, from which any ORBS holder can easily stake tokens with a Guardian of their choice. Both improvements were widely adopted by the Orbs community.</p><p  class='text-p'>Moreover, Orbs PoS assists in reducing friction for Delegators by allowing for an easy transition of delegation between Guardians through the new staking contract. Delegators can now easily modify their stake between the various Guardians using the new Tetra Wallet, without the need to unstake first.</p><p  class='text-p'>Token holders that delegate to an active Guardian are rewarded in proportion to their stake. Only delegation to an active Guardian that operates a validator node receives rewards. A Guardian that does not fulfill its responsibilities can harm the network and will cause its Delegators to lose their rewards. Therefore, it is imperative for Delegators to monitor their Guardians and make sure that they are fulfilling their responsibilities. The new features described above enable Delegators to efficiently stake to their chosen Guardian, or switch Guardians if necessary, thus helping them fulfill their important role in making the network safe and efficient.</p><p  class='text-p'>Orbs’ rewards assignment and distribution architecture provides Orbs Delegators with an additional level of confidence and predictability for their rewards allocation. Under this architecture, staking rewards are distributed directly to the Orbs Delegators on a continuous basis. This continuous reward assignment allows both Guardians and Delegators to control the rate at which they claim their rewards. Under the new architecture, a Participant can claim their rewards by sending a claim transaction to the contract. This may be done using the Tetra staking interface. As the claim transaction has a gas cost, Delegators may initiate these transactions based on their need and the current gas price, which fluctuates heavily.</p><p  class='text-p'>Following the Orbs PoS V3 release, Orbs Delegators have the ability to choose between staking on Ethereum and staking on Polygon, based on their own personal preferences and considerations.</p></section></div><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-more-btn">+ Read More</button><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-less-btn">- Read Less</button></div></div></div></div><div class="universe-bottom-links"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.orbs.com/PolygonStakingDate/" class="link-btn link-btn-right" rel="noopener"><p  class='text-p'>Orbs V3: Multi-chain Staking</p><aside class="link-btn-arrow"></aside></a><a target="_blank" href="../white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians" class="link-btn link-btn-right" rel="noopener"><p  class='text-p'>Orbs V2.5 Update documentation</p><aside class="link-btn-arrow"></aside></a></div></main><div class="gdpr"><p  class='text-p'>We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

    >The Need for Aggregated Liquidity</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>DEX-AMMs are the driving engine behind the DeFi revolution, as its most fundamental cornerstone. One of the most basic roles of any DEX is to provide its users with the best price possible when executing a trade. Better prices are obtained via better liquidity. However, on-chain liquidity is highly fragmented as it is spread across different chains, across different AMMs within the chain, and across different pools within the AMM.</p><p  class='text-p'>The problem of liquidity fragmentation in DeFi has become acute and directly impacts users via adverse exchange prices and material negative price impact on swaps.</p><p  class='text-p'>This problem contributed to the rise of liquidity aggregators such as <a href="https://1inch.io/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>1inch</a>, <a href="https://www.paraswap.io/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>ParaSwap</a>, <a href="https://swap.cow.fi/#/1/swap/WETH" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>CowSwap</a>, and others. While these aggregators do generally provide better prices as compared to any one individual DEX, thereby making it increasingly difficult for individual DEXs to compete, much of the value saving is routed into the aggregates&#39; pockets in the form of “positive slippage” and the users are not necessarily getting optimal prices.  </p><p  class='text-p'>While in the past, it seemed like most DEXs were focused on safeguarding their liquidity and volume within their own liquidity pool, it has now become ever more obvious that the future of DeFi lies with liquidity aggregation. A notable player who recently chose this path is <a href="https://uniswap.org/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Uniswap</a>, the largest DEX-AMM in existence. UniSwap recently announced <a href="https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswapx-protocol" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>UniswapX</a>, an aggregator interface outsourcing routing complexity to third-party fillers who complete swaps using on-chain third-party liquidity sources.       </p><p  class='text-p'>In light of the above, how can individual DEXs stay competitive in the age of aggregated liquidity?</p><p  class='text-p'>Introducing Liquidity Hub…</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Liquidity Hub by Orbs brings the power of aggregated liquidity to any DEX-AMM, enabling them to provide better price quotes to their users without jeopardizing their liquidity providers.</strong></p><h3 id="what-is-liquidity-hub-"  class='title-h3'
    >What is Liquidity Hub?</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub is an L3 infrastructure software that provides an optimization layer above the AMM, which taps external liquidity for better price quotes and lower price impact.</p><p  class='text-p'>Instead of the typical swap that searches for the best route within the DEX&#39;s limited liquidity pools, Liquidity Hub enhances this process by utilizing additional liquidity sources:</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>1) On-chain solver auction:</strong> Third-party solvers who compete to fill swaps using on-chain liquidity like AMM pools or their own private inventory.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>2) Decentralized orders via API:</strong> Decentralized orders, accessible using API. Enabling institutional/professional traders, such as market makers, to submit bids and compete to fill swaps.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/Liquidity-Hub-by-Orbs-The-New-Standard-for-DEXs/image1.png" alt="infographic"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub allows DEXs to attempt to execute trades without going through the AMM and experiencing AMM price impact. If the layer is unable to execute the trade at a better price than the AMM, the trade will fallback to the AMM contract and execute as usual.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, Liquidity Hub can only improve a trader’s experience. If Liquidity Hub isn’t competitive, meaning it would only execute at a worse price for the user or can’t execute at all, the swap will be routed through the AMM contract directly as usual.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/Liquidity-Hub-by-Orbs-The-New-Standard-for-DEXs/image2.png" alt="flow"></figure></p><h3 id="liquidity-hub-architecture-amp-product-spec"  class='title-h3'
    >Liquidity Hub Architecture &amp; Product Spec</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub is operated by a mix of an on-chain contract (deployed right next to the AMM contract) and backend logic (still running on-chain via Orbs decentralized L3 nodes). In any case, the Liquidity Hub on-chain contract protects end-users and ensures that their funds are safe and significant price manipulations cannot occur.</p><p  class='text-p'>Regular users attempting to swap don’t have to be aware that Liquidity Hub even exists. The Liquidity Hub contract guarantees that the execution price of the swap will be better than the execution price on the AMM contract. In other words, if Liquidity Hub isn’t competitive, it will be avoided. Since this guarantee is implemented at the contract level, there is no trust involved.</p><p  class='text-p'>Part of the Liquidity Hub logic is implemented off of the DEX’s underlying chain (off-chain risks can be mitigated using Orbs L3 as further described below). Since the data structure is held off-chain, adding and removing orders from the Liquidity Hub will take a few milliseconds (without waiting for a new block to be closed) and will not cost gas. All of these properties are attractive for market makers because they are on par with CEXs.</p><p  class='text-p'>All funds are held on-chain in a non-custodial manner. Participants that place an order in Liquidity Hub keep their funds in their own wallet. The Liquidity Hub contract will be approved to initiate the transaction that sends the funds from the account on match. Verification of orders will always take place on-chain through the Liquidity Hub contract. The contract will verify that the execution upholds both sides’ requirements and that the execution price is better than the AMM. On match, the funds will be exchanged between the parties directly on-chain.</p><p  class='text-p'>Below are the key product spec of Liquidity Hub:</p><ul>
<li>No change in the DEX UI for users.</li>
<li>API for solvers + decentralized order interface for MMs Nominal to zero latency execution for users.</li>
<li>Token spending approval by users on MetaMask.</li>
<li>Funds remain in the user wallet until trades execute.</li>
<li>Liquidity Hub trades are gasless for users (although solvers may price gas into their fees)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="liquidity-hub-main-features"  class='title-h3'
    >Liquidity Hub Main Features</h3>
<p  class='text-p'><strong>Avoiding LP Cannibalization</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>One of the primary requirements of Liquidity Hub is to avoid cannibalizing the existing AMM business. </p><p  class='text-p'>This means that existing LPs need to generate the same revenue with Liquidity Hub enabled as they would have generated without it.</p><p  class='text-p'>How is this achieved?</p><p  class='text-p'>The graph below analyzes the performance of Quickswap trades using Dune Analytics. The x-axis is the price impact (percent) suffered per trade. The y-axis is the volume. The graph is calculated over all trades over a long period of time. We’ve executed similar queries on UniSwap and Pancakeswap, and the numbers are actually almost identical.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/Liquidity-Hub-by-Orbs-The-New-Standard-for-DEXs/image3.png" alt="graph"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>The first thing we see in the graph is that price impact has two sides. Negative price impact is where users swap tokens for prices that are worse than market price. These are usually retail users. Positive price impact is where users swap tokens for prices that are better than market price. These are usually institutional arbitrageurs. An AMM is a zero sum game, for every trade with a negative price impact there’s a parallel trade with a positive one.</p><p  class='text-p'>Arbitrageurs have to compete on the positive price impact trades since those are profitable. Ordering the transactions takes place by chain validators, so they are essentially sharing a percentage of the profit with them (via MEV, gas bids, etc). </p><p  class='text-p'>Since Liquidity Hub trades have priority over AMM trades (assuming price for users is similar) and it does not rely on the chain validators for its ordering, Liquidity Hub’s function is effectively to remove these MEV losses and re-distribute them among users, LPs and solvers. In addition, Liquidity Hub’s trades don’t generate any impermanent loss for LPs, which is an improvement over AMM trades.</p><p  class='text-p'>In this way, the DEX keeps its ability to incentivize LPs to keep providing liquidity on its platform.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Cutting Out the Middleman</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub provides MEV protection.</p><p  class='text-p'>As explained above, arbitrage loss to MEV can be significant. Since Liquidity Hub matches orders off-chain (without block producers), it removes MEV losses. These savings are then re-distributed between the users and the DEX itself. This ratio can be set by the platform to best suit its needs.</p><p  class='text-p'>The distribution mechanism is a key differentiator between Liquidity Hub and other protocols such as UniSwapX.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Fully Composable Solution for Solvers</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub is a fully composable DeFi protocol building block.</p><p  class='text-p'>UniSwapX is emerging as a standard for solvers. Liquidity Hub supports UniSwapX and other similar protocols solver (or filler) API, enabling anyone to participate in the bidding process. This feature means that Liquidity Hub can connect to multiple solvers right out of the box. The DEX has the option to pre-approve solvers if it wishes to.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Fully Supports CeFi Market Makers</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub software will allow DEXs to support standard CEX book API allowing traditional MM to participate in DeFi.</p><p  class='text-p'>After having some detailed discussions with industry-leading market makers, we noticed that this class of participants is ill suited for on-chain AMM activity. The core of their business takes place on CEXs and their core expertise is book building. This expertise doesn’t come across on AMMs. Issues like gas costs for unfulfilled orders, inability to cancel orders immediately or simply lack of an order book prevent many market makers from participating in DeFi as much as they would like to.</p><p  class='text-p'>Market makers are one of the primary sources of liquidity in the industry, and the ability for a DEX to bring them into DeFi is a significant advantage. The Liquidity Hub model solves most of the issues that prevent many market makers from participating in DEXs today and opens the gate for market makers to profit from trading on such platforms.</p><p  class='text-p'>This is another key differentiator between Liquidity Hub and UniSwapX, which does not support an order book.</p><h3 id="mitigating-centralization-risks-in-liquidity-hub-using-orbs-l3"  class='title-h3'
    >Mitigating Centralization risks in Liquidity Hub using Orbs L3</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>All on-chain parts are trustless since contracts verify all actions. However, one may be concerned that the off-chain Liquidity Hub backend is able to manipulate trades in some way. This is avoided by using Orbs’ decentralized L3 technology.</p><p  class='text-p'>The <a href="https://orbs.com" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs Network</a> is an open, decentralized and public blockchain infrastructure executed by a secure network of permissionless validators (known as “Guardians”) using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. Orbs is optimized to provide “L3” services, working in conjunction with existing L1 and L2 layers and acting as a “decentralized backend” that enhances the capabilities of EVM smart contracts. Orbs Network mainnet is live since 2019 and has dozens of <a href="https://status.orbs.network/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>active validators</a> staked with <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x01d59af68e2dcb44e04c50e05f62e7043f2656c3" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>over $100M</a>.</p><p  class='text-p'>The network provides its <a href="https://www.orbs.com/execution-services/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>L3 services</a> by operating as a decentralized serverless cloud that allows developers to design applications that extend the capabilities of their smart contracts without relying on traditional centralized server solutions. These applications are deployed to be executed by the Orbs Guardians in a decentralized way.</p><p  class='text-p'>Orbs’ L3 offering is divided into two categories - ORBS-VM and ORBS-Lambda. ORBS-VM is a docker-compatible decentralized virtual machine, similar in concept to AWS EC2. This is designed for more complicated functions. </p><p  class='text-p'>For simpler functions, Orbs Network offers ORBS-Lambda - a decentralized and serverless cloud function solution, similar to AWS-Lambda. Developers can write cloud functions and, when the specified trigger occurs, Orbs Guardians then execute the function on the specified L1 blockchain in a decentralized way. </p><p  class='text-p'>As part of Liquidity Hub, Orbs Guardians will run software utilizing <a href="https://docs.orbs.network/v3/orbs-vm/what-is-orbs-vm" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>ORBS-VM</a> that acts as a decentralized backend that is required for Liquidity Hub’s off-chain portion to run optimally and in a fully decentralized manner. </p><h3 id="summary-liquidity-hub-the-next-evolution-of-dex-amms"  class='title-h3'
    >Summary: Liquidity Hub - the Next Evolution of DEX-AMMs</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Liquidity Hub brings the benefit of aggregated liquidity to any DEX-AMM in DeFi.</p><p  class='text-p'>The protocol presents significant benefits to all stakeholders:</p><ul>
<li>DEX <strong>users</strong> enjoy first and foremost better execution prices, as well as other benefits such as MEV protection. As we recall, Liquidity Hub guarantees that the final execution price of a completed transaction is always better than the AMM, all fees included. Users can only save money by using Liquidity Hub.</li>
<li>The <strong>DEX</strong> platform itself can now enjoy added liquidity and increased volumes without cannibalizing its own LP. In addition, the fee mechanism can bring additional fee revenue for the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Solvers</strong>, who are emerging as a key function in DeFi can integrate into Liquidity Hub to expand their services. Moreover, Liquidity Hub has the potential to on-board professional market makers into the space, taking DeFi to the next level.</li>
