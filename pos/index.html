Therefore, when a Guardian operates a validator node and signs a block, it is backed not just by the Guardian’s own stake, but also by the stake delegated to him. The delegated stake significantly increases the amount of stake that backs the network security and therefore increases applications&#39; trust in its operation. Moreover, the delegated stake plays an important role in preventing network attacks. An attacker that wishes to gain control of the network for a short period of time and act maliciously will need to possess more stake than the current network Guardians and their community in order to be elected.</p></section></div><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-more-btn">+ Read More</button><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-less-btn">- Read Less</button></div></div><div class="expending-box expending-box-border-top" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="expending-box-content"><h4 class="expending-box-title">Rewards Assignment and Distribution Architecture</h4><div class="expending-box-text"><section class="expending-box-text-full"><p  class='text-p'>The Guardians are the key players responsible for network security and operation. Guardians are expected to build a community of Delegators that trust them to truthfully represent their and the network’s interests.</p></section><section class="expending-box-text-more"><p  class='text-p'>Providing the Guardians with the ability to set the level of rewards that will be distributed to their respective Delegators tightens their relationships with their communities. Staking rewards are set by the Guardians, who determine how to split the rewards amongst their Delegators, while a minimum rate of compensation to Guardians is imposed by the protocol.</p><p  class='text-p'>Guardians play an important role in the reward distribution process. In V2, an automated mechanism to set the level of rewards that will be distributed to their Delegators was enabled at the protocol level and featured as part of the updated Guardian interface. The mechanism calculates the amount of rewards that each of the Guardian’s Delegators is entitled to, based on the Delegators’ stake over time and the allocated ratio. An annual reward equal to 10% of total delegated stake is awarded, addressing the tradeoff between an appealing award and sustainable inflation (see Rewards). 1⁄3 of the rewards are guaranteed to the Guardians (i.e., 3.33% for a full year of staking), while the default values for the distribution application grant the remaining 2⁄3 to Delegators (i.e., 6.66% annual reward maximum). The new automated tool allows the Guardians to modify the Delegators’ rewards split.</p><p  class='text-p'>This optimized reward distribution architecture provides a scalable and gas-efficient reward distribution that occurs through the protocol itself. Under this system, once the level of distributions is set by the Guardians, the respective rewards are distributed by the protocol directly to both the Guardians and the Delegators, on a continuous basis. Delegators and Guardians can then decide when they wish to claim their reward tokens.</p><p  class='text-p'>This has multiple important benefits such as added flexibility to the Guardians and Delegators, who may claim the staking rewards at any point in time, significant reduction in costs for Guardians, and more.</p><p  class='text-p'>To learn more about the distribution mechanism, read the documentation​ on <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>GitHub</a>.</p></section></div><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-more-btn">+ Read More</button><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-less-btn">- Read Less</button></div></div><div class="expending-box expending-box-border-top" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="expending-box-content"><h4 class="expending-box-title">PoS on Ethereum</h4><div class="expending-box-text"><section class="expending-box-text-full"><p  class='text-p'>Being a hybrid Blockchain, Orbs has always been able to utilize the benefits of both the Orbs PoS architecture along with the benefits of Ethereum - an external objective blockchain for the PoS logic.</p></section><section class="expending-box-text-more"><p  class='text-p'>ORBS token, staking, delegation and voting already operated during V1  over Ethereum contracts, utilizing Ethereum’s value as an objective auditor. In V2, the Orbs platform’s architecture was updated to run the core of the election logic on Ethereum. The entire election logic, reward calculation and distribution are carried out using Ethereum contracts, providing multiple advantages. </p><p  class='text-p'>First, it provides a high level of transparency, in particular to light clients. Orbs clients rely on the elected set of validators as the foundation on which applications’ data correctness is based. The ability of any application running on top of Orbs to validate the elected validators set by a simple light client, with no need to constantly audit the election process and PoS logic, is of high value to business applications.</p><p  class='text-p'>Second, as the token, the subscription payments and the staking are performed on Ethereum, a valid state of the elected validator nodes set on Ethereum is required for full automation of Orbs fees and rewards distribution.</p><p  class='text-p'>Third, the PoS over PoW architecture provides additional security to the network. The use of two networks allows the Orbs Network to enjoy the aggregate protection of the combined networks, as any attacker would be required to incur the costs of attacking them both. Specifically, using Ethereum, which has a robust ecosystem whose participants are, in large part, impartial regarding what happens on the Orbs Network, makes it difficult for an attacker to exploit Ethereum to launch an attack on Orbs. The security advantages of this architecture manifest in a variety of ways. For example, it provides a measure against long-range attacks, in which the attacker creates an alternative chain starting with the same genesis block that is indistinguishable from the valid chain, and then misleading users to use the malicious chain. PoS architectures are susceptible to long-range attacks because there is no extra cost to creating long chains, unlike in PoW chains, where creating a long malicious chain would involve intensive computational resources. Thus, PoS typically requires applications to audit all the network traffic in order to validate the current PoS state. Orbs’ architecture avoids this problem by taking advantage of the security provided by Ethereum.</p><p  class='text-p'>Finally, the use of this hybrid architecture ensures the integrity of elections on Orbs, since the Orbs Guardians are not entrusted to process their own election. Processing the elections on the Ethereum network provides an external guarantee that the Orbs Guardians cannot manipulate the election process.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="../Polygon-tech" rel="noopener">Orbs V3: Multi-chain Staking</a>, expanded the Orbs PoS Universe to Polygon, utilizing the Ethereum stack to its fullest potential: The security of Ethereum as the base layer, and the scalability &amp; low fees of Polygon as L2. </p><p  class='text-p'>As part of PoS V3, the full suite of <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-ethereum-contracts-v2" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs PoS Solidity contracts</a> have been deployed to Polygon mainnet. This includes the Orbs Staking Contract, the contract calculating delegations and emitting committee results and the contract distributing staking rewards.</p><p  class='text-p'>As a result, <strong>Guardians</strong> are now able to support both networks and receive delegations on both Ethereum and Polygon. Similarly, <strong>Delegators</strong> can decide on which network they want to stake their tokens - Ethereum or Polygon (or both). Since the existing Ethereum mainnet smart contracts remain intact, ORBS can still be staked on Ethereum like before. Both networks pay the same staking rewards and have the same unstaking cooldown period, but gas is cheaper on Polygon so all actions on Polygon will require a fraction of the cost in fees.</p></section></div><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-more-btn">+ Read More</button><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-less-btn">- Read Less</button></div></div><div class="expending-box expending-box-border-top" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="expending-box-content"><h4 class="expending-box-title">Election Committee</h4><div class="expending-box-text"><section class="expending-box-text-full"><p  class='text-p'>Orbs’ architecture deploys a hybrid model of two committees: General and Certified.

The Certified committee provides a suitable solution for developers with regulatory restrictions that are interested in running applications on a blockchain. Developers may also choose initially to use the Certified committee to reduce friction and transition to the General committee over time.</p></section></div><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-more-btn">+ Read More</button><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-less-btn">- Read Less</button></div></div><div class="expending-box expending-box-border-top" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="expending-box-content"><h4 class="expending-box-title">Rewards, Fees &amp; Bootstrap Fund</h4><div class="expending-box-text"><section class="expending-box-text-full"><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs incentive layer is built to incentivize a maximum overlap between the two committees. A high overlap implies a higher stake backing each committee. Guardians are incentivized to meet the certification requirements and earn additional rewards associated with participation in the certified committee. Certified Guardians are incentivized to accumulate a high stake to enjoy the rewards of the General committee.</p></section><section class="expending-box-text-more"><p  class='text-p'>The fees and rewards in the Orbs PoS architecture serve two important purposes. The first is compensation for operating a validator node. The second is a reward for contributing to network security by staking. The reward model is targeted to award the ones who deserve it - participants that contribute to the network operation and security.</p><p  class='text-p'>Operating a validator node has a cost that includes both computational resources cost and operations cost. Two forms of compensation are designed to cover these costs. First, Virtual Chain fees are paid in the form of Orbs Tokens by the network users who launch a virtual chain. The fees paid for each Virtual Chain are expected to represent the cost with a profit margin. As the network matures and runs more Virtual Chains, the cost per Virtual Chain is expected to be almost constant, representing the cost of the computational resources allocated to the Virtual Chain.</p><p  class='text-p'>This suggests a scalable solution, as the Guardians’ rewards increase as the usage increases.</p><p  class='text-p'>In order to incentivize Guardians to participate in the Certified committee by covering their costs, we included an additional bootstrap fund for Guardians who join the Certified committee. This fund is distributed in DAI, pegged to USD, popular in many DeFi applications. It provides profitability even if the token value fluctuates. Furthermore the fund is designed to cover the cost of operating a validator node while running a small number of Virtual Chains during the network early stages. This is important as it provides developers with the ease of mind that the network will continue to operate even under unexpected price fluctuations.</p><p  class='text-p'>A Guardian that operates a validator node and goes through the certification process to participate in the Certified committee will be entitled to receive the annual total of 3000 DAI. This fund provides an incentive for Guardians to participate in the Certified committee, thus increasing the participating stake in this committee and making the network more attractive to app users, while covering the reduced cost of operation as further described in the next episode.</p><p  class='text-p'>Virtual Chain fees and the bootstrap fund are awarded for the operation of validator nodes by Guardians. Therefore, unlike staking rewards, the fees and the bootstrap fund are distributed directly to the Guardians operating the validator nodes. The fees and the bootstrap fund are not staked or shared with the Delegators, allowing the Guardians to utilize them to cover their costs. The fees and the bootstrap fund are awarded for the time period that a Guardian participates in the applicable committee. Once awarded, the rewards can be claimed by the Guardian at any time.</p><p  class='text-p'>Staking rewards are awarded for the stake that elected Guardians and their Delegators allocate to contribute to the network security. It is important to note that <strong>​Only the top 22 elected Guardians are eligible for the rewards, fees and bootstrap funds</strong>.</p><p  class='text-p'>An annual reward equal to 10% of total delegated stake is awarded, addressing the tradeoff between an appealing award and sustainable inflation. 1⁄3 of the rewards are guaranteed to the Guardians (i.e., 3.33% annual reward for a full year of staking), while the default values for the distribution application grant the remaining 2⁄3 to Delegators (i.e., up to 6.66% annual reward maximum).</p></section></div><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-more-btn">+ Read More</button><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-less-btn">- Read Less</button></div></div><div class="expending-box expending-box-border-top" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="expending-box-content"><h4 class="expending-box-title">Validator Nodes Streamlining</h4><div class="expending-box-text"><section class="expending-box-text-full"><p  class='text-p'>Orbs PoS Universe V2.5 significantly reduced the cost of operating and maintaining a validator node on the Orbs Network.

Therefore, it is the role of the Orbs Delegators to actively contribute to the network’s success by staking their ORBS tokens.</p></section><section class="expending-box-text-more"><p  class='text-p'>Orbs’ ​Locking Mechanism​ (providing a 14-day cool-down period for unstaking) enhances the stability and security of the Orbs Network. In addition, the Orbs team developed TETRA​, a dedicated staking wallet, from which any ORBS holder can easily stake tokens with a Guardian of their choice. Both improvements were widely adopted by the Orbs community.</p><p  class='text-p'>Moreover, Orbs PoS assists in reducing friction for Delegators by allowing for an easy transition of delegation between Guardians through the new staking contract. Delegators can now easily modify their stake between the various Guardians using the new Tetra Wallet, without the need to unstake first.</p><p  class='text-p'>Token holders that delegate to an active Guardian are rewarded in proportion to their stake. Only delegation to an active Guardian that operates a validator node receives rewards. A Guardian that does not fulfill its responsibilities can harm the network and will cause its Delegators to lose their rewards. Therefore, it is imperative for Delegators to monitor their Guardians and make sure that they are fulfilling their responsibilities. The new features described above enable Delegators to efficiently stake to their chosen Guardian, or switch Guardians if necessary, thus helping them fulfill their important role in making the network safe and efficient.</p><p  class='text-p'>Orbs’ rewards assignment and distribution architecture provides Orbs Delegators with an additional level of confidence and predictability for their rewards allocation. Under this architecture, staking rewards are distributed directly to the Orbs Delegators on a continuous basis. This continuous reward assignment allows both Guardians and Delegators to control the rate at which they claim their rewards. Under the new architecture, a Participant can claim their rewards by sending a claim transaction to the contract. This may be done using the Tetra staking interface. As the claim transaction has a gas cost, Delegators may initiate these transactions based on their need and the current gas price, which fluctuates heavily.</p><p  class='text-p'>Following the Orbs PoS V3 release, Orbs Delegators have the ability to choose between staking on Ethereum and staking on Polygon, based on their own personal preferences and considerations.</p></section></div><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-more-btn">+ Read More</button><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-less-btn">- Read Less</button></div></div></div></div><div class="universe-bottom-links"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.orbs.com/PolygonStakingDate/" class="link-btn link-btn-right" rel="noopener"><p  class='text-p'>Orbs V3: Multi-chain Staking</p><aside class="link-btn-arrow"></aside></a><a target="_blank" href="../white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians" class="link-btn link-btn-right" rel="noopener"><p  class='text-p'>Orbs V2.5 Update documentation</p><aside class="link-btn-arrow"></aside></a></div></main><div class="gdpr"><p  class='text-p'>We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

<p  class='text-p'>Similarly to dLIMIT, these parameters provide incredible flexibility in customizing each order, taking into account factors like market conditions and current gas fees. Additionally, the UI facilitates both dTWAP-market orders, which execute all trades at the available market price, and dTWAP-Limit orders, which only execute individual trades if they are within the price Limit set by the user. Once these parameters are set, the user can approve the specific source token, place the order, and confirm their specified configuration.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/arbidex-integrates-dlimit-dtwap-powered-by-orbs/img1.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Redefining Trading Standards on Decentralized Exchanges</p><p  class='text-p'>The dLIMIT &amp; dTWAP protocols, powered by <a href="https://www.orbs.com/overview/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs L3 technology</a>, have become the industry standard for decentralized algorithmic orders in DeFi.</p><p  class='text-p'>To date, the protocol has been implemented by 8 prominent DEXs spanning 5 chains, facilitating over 5 million dollars in trading volume.</p><p  class='text-p'>For more information regarding both advanced order types, join the support <a href="https://t.me/dTWAPSupportGroup" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Telegram channel</a>.</p><p  class='text-p'>Find out more info:</p><ul>

Among other things, the ORBS token has been listed on over 20 exchanges, including venues like Binance and Bybit. This has helped the community grow. As the Orbs community has grown, so has interest in participating in staking. The Orbs project is decentralized and community-based, valuing community and core web3 values.   One way to solidify the long-term engagement of new community members is to encourage them to take an active part in the work of securing and operating the Orbs Network&#39;s technology by participating in the Orbs Proof-of-Stake Universe. To welcome and encourage new community members to participate, the Orbs community approved a governance vote to introduce the Orbs triple APY event for new stake.</p><h3 id="event-details"  class='title-h3'
