    ><em>Intro</em> <em>by</em> <a href="https://github.com/OdedWx" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@OdedWx</em></a></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Since the last tech update there has been progress on multiple fronts. The network continues to progress with new applications joining and improvements are developed. The PoS ecosystem is active and a 3rd round of reward distribution was successfully completed. Improvements to the PoS architecture are in research along with work on integrating a staking contract. And new monitoring tools are being developed to provide a better environment to application developers and plays in the PoS ecosystem.</p><p  class='text-p'>3 weeks ago an update to the network core code was deployed by the validators. Before deploying it on application’s virtual chains that are in production, the node code was deployed on a virtual chain used as a &quot;canary in the coal mine&quot; that doesn’t hold any critical assets or data. Even though the code was heavily tested including by Marvin - an innovative automated blockchain test environment - and on private networks, the deployment on the canary chain initially failed. Following a fast debug by the core team and several validators the root cause was identified and fixed. Due to Orbs virtual chains isolation architecture, the fail had no impact on any application virtual chain which later successfully deployed a fixed code (v1.3.6). The use of test methodologies has proven itself as a strong tool to maintain the applications’ stability while allowing upgrades and progress.</p><p  class='text-p'>Based on the experience with Orbs PoS ecosystem and as a next step and as part of the work on the staking contract architecture, research activities are taking place to identify improvements to the PoS architecture. The research examines the different roles in the network, the requirements from each one and incentives and rewards used to drive their honest behaviour. An additional interesting aspect of the architecture is the relationship between Orbs and Ethereum. Orbs PoS architecture enjoys the objective auditing by Ethereum, as part of improvements to the architecture changes in the logic division between the two blockchains is being investigated.</p><p  class='text-p'>The technical engagement team successfully helped two new virtual chains to onboard the network. Linet (<a href="https://validate.linet.org.il/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://validate.linet.org.il/</a>) on virtual chain 1970000 and Open Rights (<a href="https://open-rights.org" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://open-rights.org</a>) on virtual chain 1960000. Linet is a receipts notarization application leveraging Orbs public blockchain to provide proofs of in immutable and in-time generation of client receipts.  Open rights is an open database for registered users’ content allowing them to protect their IP. Application fees have been distributed to Validators through the vchain subscription process.</p><p  class='text-p'>As part of the process to make the network more friendly to applications, contributors and all PoS ecosystem players, new monitoring tools are being developed. A new monitoring tool that provides a view of the entire network status is currently under development. Once ready it will provide the players and in particular the Guardians with means to monitor the network health and validators’ operation.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><h2 id="-strong-blockchain-core-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'

<p  class='text-p'>This monthly update is more descriptive in nature, as most of the core team was (and still is) engaged as part of thePoS Architecture  Team, described below. In addition, significant effort was made to put Marvin (the testnet&#39;s testing framework) to first use. Also, a bugfix effort on v1.3.5 is described.</p><h3 id="-strong-v1-3-5-deployment-downtime-incident-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>v1.3.5 deployment downtime incident</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>On December 16th, virtual chain (VC) 5110 on mainnet was upgraded to v1.3.5. This VC is operated by Orbs Ltd. and is a pre-production VC that helps identify last-minute issues before upgrading the production VCs. Upon upgrade, the VC immediately stopped closing blocks. Most of the core contributor team stepped into an intensive research mode.</p><p  class='text-p'>Another VC was started to confirm that failure to close blocks is not specific to that specific vVC, and indeed the new VC did not close blocks either.</p><p  class='text-p'>Additional research uncovered the following:</p><ul>
<li>VC 5110 was running against an old list of validators. One of the validators had changed its Orbs address a while back, but the network topology (as defined in Boyar) the other validators used, still had the old address. This meant Gossip messages sent to that specific Validator could not reach it.</li>
<li>An update to Lean Helix algo that was introduced on v1.3.5 changed the behavior of sending messages through Gossip to a specific list of Validators, rather than to all validators indiscriminately (the motivation was to cut redundant consensus traffic between nodes). Furthermore, a Validator would try sending a message to a list of Validators in a loop and if one the send operations failed, the loop would be cut short instead of skipping to the next Validator - this a previously undetected bug.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Following these discoveries, the bug in Gossip code was fixed and deployed to the above VCs as v1.3.6, and was confirmed to fix the issue - the network resumed closing blocks. Of course the address of that specific Validator was also updated, but the important thing was the network was made more resilient as a result of fixing this bug.</p><p  class='text-p'>It took 2-3 hours to identify the root causes - this was a prime example of synergy between different  members and contributors, as all involved shared their knowledge of the system and quickly reached the correct root cause, then promptly had it fixed and deployed.</p><p  class='text-p'>Thanks to using the pre-production VC at no time was any actual production VC involved in this - these were upgraded directly to v.1.3.6 after the bug was fixed.</p><p  class='text-p'>Involved team members: <a href="https://github.com/ronnno" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@ronnno</em></a><em>,</em> <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pulls/IdoZilberberg" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@IdoZilberberg</em></a><em>,</em> <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pulls/electricmonk" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@electricmonk</em></a>, <a href="https://github.com/vistra" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@vistra</em></a>, <em><a href="https://github.com/gadcl" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>@gadcl</a>, <a href="https://github.com/OdedWx" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>@OdedWx</a>,</em> <a href="https://github.com/netoneko" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@netoneko</em></a><em>, <a href="https://github.com/andr444" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>@andr444</a>,</em> <a href="https://github.com/jlevison" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@jlevison</em></a></p><h3 id="-strong-marvin-strong-strong-strong-strong-flow-complete-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>Marvin</strong> <strong>—</strong> <strong>Flow complete!</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>There was significant progress by @IdoZilberberg and <a href="https://github.com/itamararjuan" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@itamararjuan</em></a> with running automated tests on PRs and when merging code into master branch. The CI workflow of <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>orbs-network-go</a> repo will very soon run an endurance test and compare its results against previous runs on the master branch, and against tolerable performance thresholds. If the test fails, the new version is not released to Docker hub. In case this is a new PR being pushed, the developer is notified of the test results via Slack and Github.</p><p  class='text-p'>The logic of &quot;judging&quot; whether the test passed or failed is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_Dredd" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Dredd</a>, and is part of <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/marvin" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>orbs-network/marvin</a> repo and also published to npm as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@orbs-network/judge-dredd" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>@orbs-network/judge-dredd</a> so modifying it does not require rebuilding orbs-network-go.</p><h3 id="-strong-pos-architecture-enhancements-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>PoS Architecture Enhancements</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs PoS Universe has been active for more than 9 months already. We’ve been working to learn from the PoS architecture and identify areas that may be improved towards a sustainable architecture. A multidisciplinary team that includes both researchers and core developers has been working to research the subject and propose potential architecture improvements. The work focused on three aspects: the Ethereum - Orbs architecture, integration of the staking contract and investigation of potential improvements to PoS model.</p><p  class='text-p'>The team reviewed and analyzed data of past elections and reward distribution. In addition, they reviewed the models and tools of other PoS projects trying to learn from their strong and weak points. As part of the research activity, the team has also started to collect inputs from players in the ecosystem.</p><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs platform implements a PoS over PoW architecture, in which the ORBS token, delegation and voting operate over  Ethereum. The use of Ethereum as an objective platform for the PoS architecture provides an objective mechanism for the Orbs elections and incentive layer. The use of an external and objective platform prevents a scenario where the ones being elected are the ones monitoring their honest operation. In the current PoS architecture, the PoS delegations and votes are performed on Ethereum while the election calculations are performed on Orbs.</p><p  class='text-p'>While looking into the boundaries between Orbs and Ethereum, the team has made an interesting observation in the tradeoff between liveness and consistency. In a distributed system there’s an inherent tradeoff between liveness and consistency and when designing a system architects need to favor one of them and try to maximize the other, relying on the incentive layer. For enterprise applications, finality and consistency appear to have the highest priority. An architecture where the elections are performed and calculated on Ethereum but on each state change, the currently elected set inaugurates the new one on Orbs seems to optimize both auditability on Ethereum and consistency due to a clear view of the elected set on Orbs.</p><p  class='text-p'>Another interesting aspect in the Ethereum - Orbs architecture is the potential to reduce the Ethereum requirements to a light client. The team has been working on an architecture changes to allow both auditability, relying on past events and a light client architecture without a need to maintain past state.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><h2 id="-strong-technology-engagement-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'

    >Potential Difficulties</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Naturally, deploying CBDCs involves certain difficulties, especially during the transition phase. Therefore, all relevant authorities and government agencies must be attentive and responsive in order to effectively mitigate issues as they present themselves.</p><p  class='text-p'>Among the potential difficulties we foresee, we expect the impact on the banking industry to be the most significant. As briefly described in prior witings, banks to some extent might experience a liquidity challenge affecting their available credit reserves, thus making credit more expensive through higher interest rates. There could be several paths to alleviate this and increase cash reserves:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Generating new lines of business - The banking industry could undergo a major shakeup as new blockchain-based platforms are deployed, and many traditional (and highly profitable) services will no longer be provided by banks. It will challenge banks to redefine their role in the new economy and to adapt accordingly. While some banks probably see this as a threat, others could use this as an opportunity to grab substantial market share as the demand for new financial services grows. From the general public&#39;s perspective and even the central bank&#39;s, this spur in competition is positive, forcing banks to become more efficient overall.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Central banks are in control of the deposit discount rate, and are therefore in control of the demand for CBDC and for banks&#39; cash reserves. Therefore, the likeliest scenario is one where the central bank will set an interest rate (on CBDC reserves) to reach a new, improved and stable equilibrium. That equilibrium will see only a limited portion of banks&#39; cash reserves flow to CBDC deposits, not most of it and certainly not all of it. As with other similar kinds of economic stabilization measures, it may take some time for the market to readjust, but the market will reach a new and better state, given that the central bank is trusted by the commercial banks</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The role of central banks is to balance several responsibilities in order to maintain a reliable, growing financial market. Providing the option of opening a CBDC account with the central bank makes any person or entity a de facto customer of the central bank. No one actually intends to have them deal directly with the general public, rather they would essentially outsource this service to commercial banks, generating a new line of business and new stream of revenues</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The new CBDC deposit accounts will not be credit facilities. Those will only be provided by commercial banks. Thus banks will focus on offering their customers active financial services rather than just money storage</p></li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>There may be additional difficulties involved in the process of migrating to CBDC, however we will only discuss two more: user privacy and raising sufficient public awareness.</p><p  class='text-p'>Firstly, privacy and anonymity, especially in the context of payment services, will always be a point of contention. On the one hand, many want full domain over their privacy by having the option to use fully anonymous means of payment. On the other hand, such features might be exploited by nefarious actors for illegal activity and tax evasion. As previously noted, CBDCs may provide different levels of user privacy, depending on the central bank&#39;s policy. The most simple solution would be leaving only the lowest value banknotes available, while limiting the allowed value per cash transaction. That would make the transition towards a true cashless economy smoother and quicker. In certain countries, it may even allow policy makers a defense against critics, as not all cash has been abolished.</p><p  class='text-p'>Secondly, getting the public on board may present difficulties. Public awareness campaigns and proper education should mitigate this. We truly believe that any argument that certain parts of the population could not handle this transition and might be victims for potential fraud are patently absurd. Yes, there will be fraudsters and it will take longer for some to &quot;master&quot; the use of digital payments. However, this genuine concern is not reason enough to reject change outright. Had that been the case, there would have been no move to e-banking, internet or mobile devices. Can you imagine our world today without any of them?</p><h3 id="suggested-strategic-outline"  class='title-h3'
    >Suggested Strategic Outline</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In light of the above, and assuming that we have been able to persuade the reader that CBDCs are a powerful instrument that ought to be adopted by central banks, we suggest the following strategy, which calls for a centralized CBDC on a private blockchain protocol but which allows for development into a decentralized protocol - if the technology proves itself to be viable. Deployment would occur in three steps according to this strategy, spread over several years, but starting sooner rather than later. There is no point in indicating the length of each phase, which would be an open question, but we certainly expect a central bank to set reasonable targets on this roadmap and stick to that plan.</p><ol>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 1 - Introducing CBDC Light, for digital payments only. This currency is the light version of the later full-featured centralized CBDC. The general public may open reserve accounts at the central bank, but they will not carry interest and are intended to be used as the central bank&#39;s certified digital wallets. The goal is to introduce the advantages of using digital payment services and reduce the use of cash to a minimum, leaving only the lowest value bills in circulation. This period will allow commercial banks to start getting used to the idea of having a CBDC, knowing that a full-featured CBDC is waiting just around the corner.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 2 - Introducing a full-featured centralized CBDC. Once the public and commercial banks are accustomed to this lighter CBDC, the central bank upgrades it to a full-featured implementation in order to maximize its merits and utilize it as a full monetary instrument. This period involves potential disruptions to the economy, as discussed above. It is up to the central bank to manage the process carefully in order to drive the economy towards its new equilibrium, in which commercial banks are more efficient and generate new revenue streams. In parallel, the central bank during this time closely examines blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets in order to determine when it would be suitable to deploy a decentralized CBDC</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 3 - Discussing decentralization. As noted earlier, we are still not convinced that CBDC decentralization is necessary or ever will be. Still, we urge central banks to think about it, even if just to push the envelope as a thought-experiment, so that as technology advances, they will be in a position to decide if implementation is the correct strategy for them. We are certain that with time, new technology would provide better solutions to problems that we now cannot see being resolved. Central banks should focus their efforts on understanding several key topics which are critical to a decentralized protocol:</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What is the desired level of user privacy and anonymity?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Who are the participating nodes?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>How does the White chain operate?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What are the KYC &amp; AML procedures for opening an account on that chain?</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion"  class='title-h3'
    >Conclusion</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In this series of posts, we have provided a brief overview of CBDCs and why they should be implemented sooner rather than later. Since CBDCs are such a powerful instrument, their implementation must be calculated and methodical in order to maximize their merits and minimize their demerits.</p><p  class='text-p'>The roles and importance of major actors in our global economy are constantly questioned as we head towards a &#39;new economy&#39;. Each and every one of them will have to adapt to technological innovation in order to maintain relevance and in their position of maintaining market stability. The same goes for central banks. Being the economy&#39;s equivalent of the &quot;responsible adults&quot; in the room, they must engage.</p><p  class='text-p'>We support the recent trend of central banks experimenting and considering issuing a CBDC. In our view, central banks that are looking to lead rather than be led, cannot ignore the potential benefits of this opportunity nor the pitfalls of failing to follow what seems like an inevitable culmination of digital economic innovation over the last two decades.</p></div></div></div></ul></div><div class="footer-tweets"><section class="footer-section-title"><img
