Real businesses are yet to see the value in public blockchain technology and adoption crawls. I believe this is largely caused by the blockchain dichotomy: the polarization of infrastructure solutions in the industry today. If this indeed is the cause, we can design architectures around it. Will this be enough to make mainstream adoption possible?</em></p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'>There’s a feeling in the industry that blockchain is slow to deliver on its promise. The impact of this technology on the world is still small. This may be the result of unrealistic expectations due to the abundance of hype, but there’s no argument that the market is slow to mature.</p><p  class='text-p'>We are past the point of demonstrating the conceptual innovation in blockchain. It is undeniable that this technology is capable of solving problems that we’ve previously had no solution for. But why are mainstream businesses barely using it to solve real world problems? Why is there so little adoption?</p><p  class='text-p'>I talk to many tech companies. Almost all of them have looked into the technology. Many have even assigned a product manager to analyze the field. But when I ask this product manager what immediate value they see in public blockchain, they struggle to give a straightforward answer. Unsurprisingly, most of them don’t have concrete plans to incorporate the technology in their roadmaps. Most of them even struggle to provide one solid use-case where it can be used.</p><h3 id="-strong-the-blockchain-dichotomy-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>The blockchain dichotomy</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>I believe adoption is slow because our industry is severely polarized. Solutions are moving between two opposite extremes - and mainstream adoption is falling right in the gap.</p><p  class='text-p'>On the one hand, we have public blockchains like Ethereum, Tezos and Polkadot. Beautiful solutions, but their approach to ‘publicness’ focuses on absolute decentralization of businesses. Their public offering resonates mostly with pure dapps, a new type of business model that is just emerging. They aim for a new Internet, where middlemen like Uber Ltd are replaced with new decentralized Ubers, incorporating peer-to-peer token economies instead of the traditional for-profit model of the business world. The problem these infrastructures are solving today is not in high demand from existing mainstream businesses and their optimizations make them too expensive and impractical for popular use.</p><p  class='text-p'>On the other hand, we have private and permissioned blockchains like Hyperledger. They are pragmatic and easy to use, but provide questionable benefit over traditional databases. They don’t focus on the value of permissionlessness and therefore cannot give strong external guarantees to their users. I believe these solutions miss out on what is truly disruptive about blockchain and where the big value awaits.</p><p  class='text-p'>Is it possible to bridge this dichotomy? Or is this polarization inherent to the nature of the technology itself?</p><h3 id="-strong-what-are-we-trying-to-solve-anyways-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>What are we trying to solve, anyways?</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Before we can start thinking about architectures for bridging dichotomies, we need concrete definitions for what we’re trying to solve. The value-add of the technology isn’t clear to mainstream businesses. So, what is the purpose of the public blockchain?</p><p  class='text-p'>The first thing people say as a response to this question is usually <em>decentralization</em> - we’re trying to decentralize aspects of business. When trying to pitch decentralization to a business, the first question asked is will decentralization make me more profitable? The industry is struggling to provide a convincing answer to this question.</p><p  class='text-p'>I prefer a different answer. I see pragmatic blockchain technology as the infrastructure to build applications that provide three interesting guarantees to users: <em>auditability</em>, <em>forkability</em> and <em>governance</em>. I won’t go into detail about each guarantee, it is covered in a <a href="../defining-the-public-blockchain" rel="noopener">previous post</a>. These guarantees can help make businesses more profitable, see analogies from the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/blockchain-as-the-next-evolutionary-step-of-the-open-source-movement/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>open source movement</a>.</p><p  class='text-p'>Now, that we have a concrete answer, we can explore how these guarantees are actually given.</p><h3 id="-strong-block-producers-and-validators-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>Block producers and validators</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'><em>Block producers</em>, <em>validators</em>, <em>miners</em> - are all similar terms in blockchain architecture. They refer to the entities in the network that are charged with selecting transactions, packing them inside blocks and signing these blocks as part of the consensus process. Every block that passes consensus is added to the chain, thus creating the <em>block chain</em>.</p><p  class='text-p'>The first interesting distinction we’re making in Orbs is separating between <em>block producers</em> and <em>validators</em>. Block producers are the ones proposing blocks, validators are the ones signing and verifying them.</p><p  class='text-p'>The consensus process in the network adds blocks to the chain one after the other. When work starts on a new block, one of the <em>block producers</em> chooses transactions that will go into this block and packs them inside. This includes executing the transactions, recording the changes in state and so forth.</p><p  class='text-p'>Now, that a new block is proposed, it must undergo consensus. This block is sent to <em>validators</em> which verify that the block follows the protocol. They verify that indeed the transactions are valid, that execution is correct, the state changes add up and so forth. If valid, they sign the block. When enough signatures are collected - beyond the consensus threshold - the block is accepted and added to the chain.</p><p  class='text-p'>Many blockchain architectures today use the same entities for both tasks. <em>Block producers</em> usually act as <em>validators</em> for each other. There is normally only one group.</p><p  class='text-p'>Making the separation between the two possible in the Orbs architecture provides some interesting benefits and in my eyes plays a major part in the solution.</p><h3 id="-strong-proof-of-stake-and-a-public-pool-of-validators-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>Proof-of-stake and a public pool of validators</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>At the heart of the Orbs ecosystem is a permissionless pool of validators that is elected by ORBS token holders. I will not go into the specifics of the Orbs proof-of-stake architecture and how <em>guardians</em> and <em>delegators</em> work together to accomplish this task. See <a href="https://www.orbs.com/the-orbs-pos-universe-archetypes/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>relevant posts</a> on the subject.</p><p  class='text-p'>I will only emphasize that the purpose of the Orbs incentives model is to actively maintain a quality pool of trustworthy validators that act in the best interest of the network and uphold the protocol. These validators are public in essence, chosen in a decentralized and permissionless way, as common in other proof-of-stake models prevalent in the industry.</p><h3 id="-strong-virtual-chains-and-governance-autonomy-of-apps-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>Virtual chains and governance autonomy of apps</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Another important element of the architecture is <em>virtual chains</em>. The Orbs network runs multiple isolated virtual chains in parallel on the same physical infrastructure of nodes and validators. Every app would normally run on its own virtual chain under the illusion of having its own dedicated blockchain.</p><p  class='text-p'>There are many benefits to this approach, from infinite horizontal scalability (virtual chains are inherently sharded) to the ability to provide apps with dedicated and reserved resources that guarantee performance.</p><p  class='text-p'>The most important benefit though is not related to performance, it has to do with <em>isolation.</em> Different virtual chains are isolated, particularly in regard to governance. Every virtual chain has its own chain of blocks advancing independently and its own instance of the consensus algorithm executing in parallel.</p><p  class='text-p'>This means that if an app has a catastrophic bug, like in the case of <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-story-of-the-dao-its-history-and-consequences-71e6a8a551ee" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>The DAO</a>, an extreme governance decision like changing history would not impact the other virtual chains. Their blocks would not be affected.</p><p  class='text-p'>Every app is required to declare and implement its governance model as a set of smart contracts running in its virtual chain. This enables each virtual chain to make its own autonomous governance decisions, like choosing its consensus algorithm. What else should we let every app control?</p><h3 id="-strong-can-apps-choose-block-producers-and-validators-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>Can apps choose block producers and validators?</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>If an app is free to make governance decisions in its virtual chain, the immediate question becomes: Can an app choose its own <em>block producers</em>? Moreover, can an app choose its own <em>validators</em>?</p><p  class='text-p'>It turns out this question is one of the most profound ones any blockchain infrastructure has to answer. Let’s explore the matrix of possibilities:</p><h4 id="-strong-1-apps-can-t-choose-their-own-block-producers-apps-can-t-choose-their-own-validators-strong-"  class='title-h4'
    ><strong>1. Apps can’t choose their own block producers, apps can’t choose their own validators</strong></h4>
<p  class='text-p'>If we’re not letting the app choose the identities of either group, this means both groups must be designated by the network. In the Orbs case, it means both groups come from the permissionless validator pool elected by ORBS token holders according to the Orbs proof-of-stake model.</p><p  class='text-p'>This approach takes us to the extreme “public” side of the blockchain dichotomy. It is similar in concept to how blockchains like Ethereum and Tezos work today. Apps running on these blockchains must naturally accept the public miners of these blockchains - assembled using incentives systems unrelated to the app.</p><h4 id="-strong-2-apps-can-choose-their-own-block-producers-apps-can-choose-their-own-validators-strong-"  class='title-h4'
    ><strong>2. Apps can choose their own block producers, apps can choose their own validators</strong></h4>
<p  class='text-p'>If we’re letting the app choose the identities of both groups, the app does not rely on the public validator pool at all. This means effectively that the app’s <em>block producers</em> and <em>validators</em> are subject to the governance model of the app itself.</p><p  class='text-p'>If the app governance is permissioned (eg. some entity under the app calls the shots), these groups will be permissioned. If the app governance is permissionless (eg. proof-of-stake using the app’s secondary token), these groups will be permissionless but subject to the app’s own incentive model - not the network’s. The repercussions from this are vast and probably deserve their own dedicated blog post.</p><p  class='text-p'>This approach takes us to the extreme “private” side of the blockchain dichotomy. It is similar in concept to how blockchains like Hyperledger work. Apps running on these blockchains control their own private fate.</p><p  class='text-p'>These are the two extremes we’re well familiar with. Is there a third option?</p><h4 id="-strong-3-apps-can-choose-their-own-block-producers-but-cannot-choose-their-own-validators-strong-"  class='title-h4'
    ><strong>3. Apps can choose their own block producers, but cannot choose their own validators</strong></h4>
<p  class='text-p'>Now things are beginning to get interesting under the Orbs architecture. <em>Block producers</em> can be chosen by the app - subject to whatever governance model the app has (permissioned or permissionless), but the <em>validators</em> are designated by the network - coming from the Orbs public and permissionless validator pool elected by ORBS token holders.</p><p  class='text-p'>It seems that this approach does not fall under any of the extremes of the dichotomy. It falls somewhere in the middle.</p><p  class='text-p'>And this is exciting.</p><h3 id="-strong-back-to-our-three-guarantees-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>Back to our three guarantees</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>We’ve defined earlier pragmatic blockchain technology as the infrastructure to build applications that provide three interesting guarantees to users: <em>auditability</em>, <em>forkability</em> and <em>governance</em>.</p><p  class='text-p'>Let’s explore forkability for a minute because it’s arguably the most interesting of the three. Forkability is the ability of every app user to fork the app at will, with all of its code and data. The ability to fork creates a healthy balance of power. If control of the app is abused and a community of users or partners feel wronged by whichever app governance model was chosen, this community can easily run its own duplicate instance of the app. They are not held hostage. If this does not happen and the app remains the popular fork, this means no other fork is doing a better job. This sums up forkability.</p><p  class='text-p'>So, what do we need in order to guarantee app users the ability to fork?</p><p  class='text-p'>This is actually pretty simple. All they need is access to all the blocks in the app’s virtual chain. Since smart contracts are stored on state, and state changes are stored on blocks, both code and data will be available this way.</p><p  class='text-p'>The act of forking a virtual chain is trivial on Orbs.

    ><strong>Comparing the matrix of choices</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Both extremes of the dichotomy are possible under the Orbs architecture but both have significant disadvantages for the mainstream.</p><p  class='text-p'>Forcing the public pool of network validators for the app’s <em>block producers</em> and <em>validators</em> is the “public” extreme. It is possible to give the three guarantees this way, but the hosted app becomes absolutely decentralized. This would be expensive and impractical for many mainstream businesses. Nevertheless, this approach is supported and works well for pure dapps.</p><p  class='text-p'>Giving the app full control of its <em>block producers</em> and <em>validators</em> is the “private” extreme. It is very practical for mainstream businesses, but it turns out that it is <strong>not possible</strong> to give the three guarantees this way. Therefore, this approach misses out on what we’ve defined as the value-add of blockchain. The app might as well run on a plain old database instead.</p><p  class='text-p'>But what about the third option? Control over <em>block producers</em>, but no control over <em>validators</em>.</p><p  class='text-p'>Forcing the public pool of network validators for the app’s <em>validators</em> turns out to be enough to provide us with all three guarantees. This means the value-add of blockchain is there. Yet, giving the app control of its <em>block producers</em> makes a big difference - it makes the solution suddenly much more practical for mainstream businesses. Why is that?</p><h3 id="-strong-control-of-block-producers-is-important-for-mainstream-adoption-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>Control of block producers is important for mainstream adoption</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Giving a mainstream app control of its <em>block producers</em> alleviates many of the fears of decentralizing too aggressively. It makes the process of migrating to blockchain feasible for existing businesses.</p><p  class='text-p'>First, it takes care of concerns about <em>security</em>. This may seem counter intuitive, but for mainstream apps, switching to the fully decentralized security model of blockchain actually adds risk. Uber does not have substantial security concerns, it’s perfectly confident in own its ability to secure its own app in a centralized way. Uber will not switch to blockchain for the security. If anything, Uber will avoid switching to blockchain for the fear of giving an unknown group of anonymous nodes full control of its own security.</p><p  class='text-p'>Controlling its <em>block producers</em> will allow Uber to act as its own block producer. If they don’t trust anyone else, they can even be the only block producer, keeping their fate in their own hands. External validators only verify blocks, they don’t propose them. Even if all <em>validators</em> collude against Uber, they won’t be able to change data or steal anything. The maximum damage they can do is impact the liveness of the app. And that’s not necessarily a bad thing, because if Uber itself is compromised by bad actors, these validators will prevent bad actors from doing damage to the users.</p><p  class='text-p'>Second, this reduces costs, dramatically. One of the biggest downsides of blockchain for mainstream businesses is that running on blockchain is thousands of times more expensive than the alternative. The value-add of blockchain has to be immense for this to make sense. And this unfortunately isn’t the case for most apps.</p><p  class='text-p'>Running a <em>validator</em> is significantly cheaper than running a <em>block producer</em>. <em>Validators</em> can be stateless. For Uber, running its own <em>block producers</em> is not very different cost-wise from running its own servers as it does today. The extra costs of blockchain are reflected in the overhead payment for the validators of the public pool.</p><p  class='text-p'>Third, the focus on adding guarantees for users, and not on absolute decentralization. The idea is not to tear down Uber and replace it with a new fully decentralized Uber. This is not practical, particularly not for Uber Ltd. We’re not trying to build a new Internet. We’re trying to improve existing apps and make them more attractive to users and partners by helping them offer stronger guarantees. Defining the value-add of public blockchain as the ability to give these guarantees, and not as absolute decentralization, suddenly makes the value-add of blockchain applicable for the mainstream.</p><h3 id="-strong-gradual-and-responsible-decentralization-for-apps-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>Gradual and responsible decentralization for apps</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The Orbs architecture provides apps with several degrees of control that make migration to blockchain a potentially <em>gradual</em> process. This stems from our realization that most existing businesses cannot decentralize overnight.</p><p  class='text-p'>How is this made possible for an app?</p><p  class='text-p'>First, by giving it autonomous governance. The fact that every virtual chain is free to make its own governance decisions, means that decisions of one app do not affect another. <strong>Every app can decentralize in its own pace.</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>Second, by controlling its <em>block producers</em>. An existing app can start by being its own only <em>block producer</em>. The platform is still able to provide the three guarantees in this case. As the app is ready to trust additional partners, for example when expanding its ecosystem, it can add additional <em>block producers</em> from trusted partners. The final step will be making its <em>block producer</em> pool permissionless. The app can do this under its own incentive model or use the public permissionless validator pool of Orbs for the task. This would make the final step into the “public” extreme of the dichotomy - but only if and when the app is ready.</p><p  class='text-p'>If desired, it is also possible for the app to start from the “private” extreme of the dichotomy and even control its own <em>validators</em>. As we’ve seen before, the benefit of blockchain in this case is small, because the three guarantees will not be given. The value-add of blockchain will not manifest. Nevertheless, apps that only desire to be <em>public-ready</em> can start experimenting with the technology this way.</p><p  class='text-p'>Third, by evolving its own governance model. The governance model of an app is implemented as smart contracts running on its virtual chain. This governance model can start centralized with one entity making all decisions. This gives existing apps control but doesn’t impact the platform’s ability to offer the three guarantees. As the app’s desire to decentralize grows, this governance model can be upgraded to a more decentralized one. If the app has its own token economy, for example, it can use stake based votes on its own secondary token to make internal governance decisions in a purely decentralized way.</p><h3 id="-strong-conclusion-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The blockchain dichotomy is holding blockchain adoption back. Solutions today are either overly decentralized on the “public” extreme or overly permissioned on the “private” extreme. We can either tear down existing applications and build a new Internet or stay behind with the old Internet and miss out on everything blockchain can offer.</p><p  class='text-p'>Separating between <em>block producers</em> and <em>validators</em> may provide the missing flexibility. Allowing <em>block producers</em> to remain “private” while forcing <em>validators</em> to become “public” allows mainstream applications to retain a level of control and keep infrastructure costs sane.</p><p  class='text-p'>This approach is still able to offer the public essence of blockchain - of open ecosystems and trustless decentralized collaboration that can make businesses more competitive. Allowing existing apps to give strong guarantees to their users and partners - <em>auditability</em>, <em>forkability,</em> and <em>governance -</em> is what public blockchain should really be about.</p><p  class='text-p'>I believe that the dichotomy we’re seeing today will gradually disappear. Both extremes will have to take steps to become closer. Solutions on the “public” extreme like Ethereum and Tezos will become more appealing to the mainstream by adopting architectures like separating block producers and validators. Solutions on the “private” extreme will add Byzantine fault tolerance and other ideas from public blockchains to provide stronger guarantees to their users.</p></div></div></div><div class="single-blog-bottom"><h3 class="single-blog-bottom-title">Get involved</h3><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex flex-between"><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/logo.svg" alt="orbs logo"/><h4>White Papers</h4><a href="../white-papers" target="_blank">Read the Orbs white papers</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/github.svg" alt="github icon"/><h4>GitHub Repos</h4><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network" target="_blank">Review the code &amp; contribute</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/documents.svg" alt="document icon"/><h4>Documentation</h4><a href="https://docs.orbs.network" target="_blank">Developer documentation</a></div></div></div></main><div class="gdpr"><p  class='text-p'>We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

    >Orbs 3.0 &amp; Web3</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>At the start of 2022, we sought to define Orbs’ place in web3; this was dubbed Orbs 3.0. Orbs 3.0 is the overarching framework for the project. The components are comprised of multi-chain proof-of-stake (PoS), L3 Orbs, and web3.  </p><p  class='text-p'>With regards to web3,  both at the beginning of the year, and now, Orbs has been based on the <a href="https://defi.org/defi-belief-system/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>philosophy</a> that web3 is the pursuit of creating permissionless applications where users can have a stake in the project, participate in governance votes, own their data, and can monetize their stake. </p><p  class='text-p'>Everything created for the Orbs project in  2022 was aligned with this philosophy and furthers the web3 narrative. </p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/Orbs-in-2022-Driving-Forces-of-Adoption/image1.jpeg" alt="Orbs3"></figure></p><h3 id="pos-v3-multi-chain-staking"  class='title-h3'
    >PoS V3 Multi-chain Staking</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>For those unfamiliar, the Orbs protocol is decentralized and executed by a public network of permissionless validators (dubbed &quot;Guardians&quot;) using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. The Orbs protocol relies on the ORBS token, which provides a system of incentives used to elect Guardians in a secure and decentralized manner.</p><p  class='text-p'>In response to community feedback to mitigate gas spikes, in 2022 we launched <a href="https://www.orbs.com/polygon-staking/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>multi-chain staking</a> on Ethereum and Polygon, dubbed PoS V3. The upgrade allowed the Orbs network to utilize the available blockchain stack to its fullest potential, the security of Ethereum as the base layer, and the scalability &amp; low fees of Polygon as a layer 2.</p><p  class='text-p'>After a year of multi-chain staking being live, there are <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x614389eaae0a6821dc49062d56bda3d9d45fa2ff?a=0xeeae6791f684117b7028b48cb5dd21186df80b9c#tokenAnalytics" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>191 million</a> ORBS staked at the time of writing on Polygon with an additional <a href="https://analytics.orbs.network/ethereum/overview/stake" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>775 million</a> ORBS staked on Ethereum. This past year, the number of Guardians has also grown, with 7 new Guardians helping to secure the network and fostering community growth.</p><h3 id="orbs-as-a-layer-3-blockchain"  class='title-h3'
    >Orbs as a Layer-3 blockchain</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>At the start of the year, we <a href="https://www.orbs.com/How-Orbs-Hybrid-Architecture-Is-Becoming-a-Game-Changer-in-DeFi/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>explained</a> to the community what Orbs as a layer 3 protocol meant and defined the goal of positioning Orbs onto the existing blockchain stack; and to have a fully functioning use case by the end of 2022.  </p><p  class='text-p'>Since then, we’ve developed Orbs’ two main L3 execution services: <a href="https://www.orbs.com/Deep-Dive-to-Orbs-Lambda/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs Lambda</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.orbs.com/Deep-Dive-to-Orbs-VM/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs VM</a>. Orbs Lambda functions as a decentralized serverless cloud and Orbs VM as a Docker-based decentralized virtual machine. This technology has been able to power L3 DeFi applications such as The Open DeFi Notification Protocol &amp; dTWAP.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://defi.org/notifications/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>DeFi notifications</a> is the first in-house use case developed for L3 Orbs. Since its inception at the beginning of the year, it has been integrated with 30+ dApps, and successfully audited over 200,000 on-chain transactions, with 3,500+ active users receiving notifications across 6 different chains. This a remarkable achievement for something launched just in this past year with a very small target audience.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/Orbs-in-2022-Driving-Forces-of-Adoption/image2.jpg" alt="Notifications"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Taking this one step further, the newest and now deployed use case of Orbs operating as an L3 is dTWAP. This is a major step forward for Orbs L3 as it is the first use case that adds capabilities to dApps with significant TVL. First deployed on <a href="https://www.spiritswap.finance/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>SpiritSwap</a>, and now within striking distance of going live on <a href="https://spooky.fi/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>SpookySwap</a> and <a href="https://www.pangolin.exchange/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Pangolin</a>, the entire community can celebrate this achievement and get excited about this integration pipeline. </p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/Orbs-in-2022-Driving-Forces-of-Adoption/image3.jpg" alt="dTWAP"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>In this arena, the project’s goal for 2023 will be to integrate dTWAP with additional major dexes, establish Orbs as a major player in DeFi, and solidify the network’s position as an L3. With these ambitions in mind, a high priority will be to launch other Orbs DeFi layer 3 use cases during 2023.</p><h3 id="launching-orbs-governance"  class='title-h3'
    >Launching Orbs Governance</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In alignment with the project’s core web3 philosophy, Orbs governance was <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-governance/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>introduced</a> and <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/orbs-network.eth" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>launched</a> in August. Since its launch, there have been three governance proposals, some directly affecting Orbs PoS V3, with another in progress. Accounting for all four votes, over 1.5 billion $ORBS participated. This signified the community&#39;s confidence in the project &amp; reflected their high level of engagement.</p><p  class='text-p'>The <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/orbs-network.eth/proposal/0x770671f96d4eca72867acc6b4ce645cbd76e17e47a69f6da28ad9783b1aae930" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>first proposal</a> asked the community if they’d like to reinstate a minimum amount that Guardians (validators) must self-delegate. The vote went down to the wire with just 54% of the vote saying yes and 46% disagreeing. Following the first proposal, the community then voted on the amount minimum self-delegation should be, with 3% self-delegation winning with <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/orbs-network.eth/proposal/0xc2f4c60c94b6955dfd6ccfbfdbd40dc8f516352e015dce0f5deac9186154095f" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>56% of the total vote</a>. </p><p  class='text-p'>The third vote this year was on <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/orbs-network.eth/proposal/0xa347f2d0090ad863d5afb8a20bb2d42e8bbd86a72e34ba915738c6f0cce83e6c" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs improvement proposals</a> which created a forum on <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/OIPs" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>GitHub</a> where anyone in the Orbs ecosystem can suggest improvements to the Orbs protocol and following a discussion can be voted on via Snapshot.</p><h3 id="ton"  class='title-h3'
    >TON</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Lastly, Orbs has further solidified its position as blockchain-agnostic by integrating with the <a href="https://ton.org/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>TON blockchain</a>, the first non-EVM chain the Orbs project is building on. For a brief history lesson, the Durov brothers, the founders of Telegram, released a whitepaper for a blockchain in 2018 and began working on it until 2020 when it was forced to shut down operations by the SEC. However, since it was all open-sourced, a group of enthusiasts continued the project and are now being integrated with Telegram in modern-day 2022.</p><p  class='text-p'>TON has the potential to onboard Telegram’s <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/telegram-statistics/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>500M+</a> monthly active users onto the Blockchain. The approach to integrating Orbs and TON has been to build out core infrastructure components of the network, consult on best practices for L1s, and assist across all aspects of the project when necessary. Orbs recently released <a href="https://www.orbs.com/Announcing-TON-Minter-by-Orbs" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>TON Minter</a>, which became the official way to deploy Jettons on the TON chain (Similar to ERC-20 tokens). Despite launching at the beginning of the month, the tool has already seen significant usage, with 4,300 developers mining more than 470+ tokens. Additionally, Orbs released <a href="https://tonverifier.live/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>TON verifier</a> at the end of the year, which verifies the source code of TON contracts powered by Orbs L3.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/Orbs-in-2022-Driving-Forces-of-Adoption/image4.jpg" alt="TONVerifier"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs team has attended meetups, hackathons, and more in an effort to build a close relationship with the foundation. Tal Kol, Orbs CTO, has become a TON ambassador, showcasing the close ties between Orbs and the foundation. Our goal for Orbs on TON is as the network is further developed, Orbs will be positioned to become a major player in the ecosystem to power decentralized applications. This has huge potential for bringing usage to Orbs, especially if TON can onboard the next generation of users into web3 this coming year.</p><div class='line-separator'> </div>

<p  class='text-p'>In summary, this past year has been a period of significant building and development growth for the Orbs ecosystem. The project has not only achieved all of the goals for this year but also surpassed them in some areas. The entire Orbs community can look forward to continuing the web3 philosophy and establishing Orbs as a major layer-3 throughout the entire blockchain ecosystem in 2023. If you’re in the area, be sure to meet during the Orbs team’s conference attendance in Austin Texas, Korea, Japan, and elsewhere in 2023. </p></div></div></div><div class="blog-element" data-url="../announcing-support-for-ton-connect-2.0-in-minter-and-verifier" data-image="../assets/img/blog/announcing-support-for-ton-connect-2.0-in-minter-and-verifier/bg.jpeg" data-title="Announcing support for TON Connect 2.0 in Minter and Verifier" data-prefix="On" data-date="Dec 29, 2022"><div class="single-blog-header header"><h1 class="single-blog-header-title">Announcing support for TON Connect 2.0 in Minter and Verifier</h1><div class="single-blog-header-author-flex"><div class="single-blog-header-author flex-start"><section class="blog-author-details flex-start"><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/team/members/small/shahar.jpg" alt="Shahar Yakir"></figure>

<p  class='text-p'>In simple terms, TON Connect does the heavy lifting for dApp developers by publishing the list of supporting wallets and their connection details. This allows the dApp developer to create a dynamic list of wallets, each of which works with the same connection and transaction-sending API. This enables the dApp developer to focus on building the app and minimizing wallet-interaction logic to a minimum.</p><p  class='text-p'>From a user perspective, any TON Connect 2.0 compatible wallet can interact with any TON Connect 2.0 compatible dApp. dApps will now be able to retrieve the user&#39;s wallet address and send transactions from the application to the wallet for approval. This will make everything from connecting to usage seamless.</p><p  class='text-p'>Further, TON Connect 2.0 is an entirely open-sourced protocol and allows 3rd party wallet developers to integrate without friction, eliminating walled gardens.</p><h3 id="ton-minter-and-ton-verifier-add-support-for-tc2"  class='title-h3'
