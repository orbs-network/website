    ><strong>Highlights</strong></h2>
<p  class='text-p'><em>This segment was contributed by</em> <a href="https://github.com/OdedWx" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@OdedWx</em></a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://github.com/talkol" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@talkol</em></a></p><p  class='text-p'>Hi community, this has been a busy month since the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/orbs-rd-update-june-2019/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>last R&amp;D update</a>!</p><p  class='text-p'>The biggest thing happening was the first ever rewards distribution. As you know, the rewards are given and accounted for on an ongoing basis (on every election), but the tokens themselves are distributed over Ethereum in bulk after 3 months. We’ve had our first successful distribution which included the first 27 election periods (1 through 27)!</p><p  class='text-p'>Some statistics: 18,018,788 ORBS were distributed to 1,448 addresses. The distribution took place by a <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5627766a3f55354a2cd70f9153a2bebe1053d2f5c99aec647027ce85e93b3f1b" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>smart contract on Ethereum</a>, to make sure we have a third party external verification of the entire process. There’s a very nice architecture that requires only a single transaction with commitments for the entire distribution event. Following the commitment transaction, any account may send the distribution transactions relying on the commitments. This means that the process is transparent and easy to review and also very efficient (50 distributions per transaction). <a href="https://www.orbs.com/first-orbs-rewards-distribution-summary/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>See this post describing the entire process</a>.</p><p  class='text-p'>Another area the contributors have been focusing on this month is production network fixes. The network is up in production since March, and is constantly monitored for issues and improvements. For example, the lean helix threading model was improved, preventing corner cases that may cause a delay in a block creation. Another example is improvements to the gossip threading model.</p><p  class='text-p'>There’s a lot of excitement in the community for working with the system and making this process easy for developers. One very exciting project I want to point out is the Orbs Playground - an online IDE for smart contract developers that lets them experiment and develop smart contracts on Orbs directly from their web browser - without downloading and installing any tools! This very cool tool started as a hackathon project, but got such a good feedback that it became a standalone project that is now actively maintained. Also look forward to seeing it embedded more in more in the various Orbs websites.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><h2 id="-strong-blockchain-core-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'

Presently, the algorithm suffers from less-than-ideal performance when the rate of incoming transactions is low, due to having a single goroutine for waiting for new transactions, and for handling external events such as Node Sync and Leader Election in Lean Helix. Following several proof-of-concept iterations, a new model was decided upon, and development is underway! This work is expected to complete during July, more details will be available in the next update (stay tuned).</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pulls/electricmonk" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@electricmonk</em></a> completed an update of the Gossip goroutine threading model in <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1211" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>PR1121</a>. Before this change, DirectTransport had a goroutine per connection, and handling a message occurred on that goroutine. This effectively blocked further communication from that peer for the duration it takes to handle the message. Some Gossip consumers, such as the LeanHelix consensus algo, may block for a long time, if - for instance - it is waiting for a new block to be produced.</p><p  class='text-p'>This PR creates a goroutine per Gossip topic, writing from the connection goroutines to the topic goroutines via a buffered channel. Essentially this serializes all messages from <em>all peers</em> to a single goroutine, but frees the connection goroutines to handle subsequent messages, and guarantees QoS per topic.</p><p  class='text-p'>In addition, the code now creates a one-off goroutine per Block Sync request, so that scanning blocks or reading chunks from disk will not block the Block Sync topic goroutine. Another PR, <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1193" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#1193</a>, upgrades the Orbs platform to compile using Golang 1.12.6 (previously 1.11.x was used).</p><p  class='text-p'>It is expected that the Lean Helix topic will not be blocked, as it will have a goroutine that deals with reading from the topic.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/noambergIL" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@noambergIL</em></a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pulls/IdoZilberberg" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@IdoZilberberg</em></a> updated code in <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/lean-helix-go/pull/49" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>PR49</a>, <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1202" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>PR1202</a> to support <em>Sign()</em> becoming an external service - to that end, a cancellable Go context was added as a parameter to this method.</p><p  class='text-p'>More PRs by <a href="https://github.com/noambergIL" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@noambergIL</em></a>:</p><ul>

<p  class='text-p'>There are multiple application use cases being developed across the community these days (that I’m aware of). These projects will be elaborated upon in dedicated blog posts as they mature, so here we’ll provide some basic descriptions and details:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'>A POC with a leading academic institution regarding blockchain-based music rights management - this is a well-known pain in the industry, and we believe our Orbs-based solution can provide a valuable service. The developed POS combines on-chain rights registry with off-chain indexing and storage.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>A collection of use-cases with a media distributor to create a blockchain-based content registry (photos, videos etc.) and enable search, collaboration and monetization. Some interesting use-cases include:</p><ul>
<li>Smart contracts to register and search for registered images - including a perceptual hash search that finds images similar to provided ones</li>
<li>Chrome extension - to highlight registered images in a browser and retrieve their metadata</li>
<li>Webcrawler - retrieve metadata for all images on a webpage</li>
</ul>

    ><strong>Research and Architecture</strong></h2>
<p  class='text-p'><em>This segment was contributed by</em> <a href="https://github.com/avilanthe1" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@Avilanthe1</em></a></p><p  class='text-p'>Orbs’ research efforts continue with researchers and developers work on different aspects of the Orbs blockchain infrastructure! Here is a breakdown:</p><h3 id="pos-research"  class='title-h3'
    >PoS Research</h3>
<h5 id="-strong-market-research-strong-"  class='title-h5'
    ><strong>Market research</strong></h5>
<p  class='text-p'>Resources are dedicated to researching the PoS market. There are two sides to this market: Projects, and ecosystem players. On the projects’ side, Orbs researchers have been focused on learning ~20 different projects which have a PoS element to them. In particular, they’ve been trying to understand what goals were the projects trying to realize via specific design choices, and how ecosystem players eventually chose to respond. On the ecosystem players side, mapping the market to different types of players — staking services, infrastructure services, lending platforms, exchanges, etc to how each type may benefit/harm a PoS network.</p><h5 id="-strong-open-and-competitive-validators-nomination-process-strong-"  class='title-h5'
    ><strong>Open and competitive validators nomination process</strong>.</h5>
<p  class='text-p'>Currently, Validators undergo a due diligence process in order to evaluate their technical abilities and enabling gradual rollout. Orbs architects are working on an architecture that enables to remove the need for due diligence and enables an open and competitive process. This competition, as a by-product, should increase the security of the network and its usability.</p><p  class='text-p'>As a first step to achieve this, we are working on a locking contract for Validators and Validator candidates. This locking contract, deployed on Ethereum, is designed to match the Orbs election architecture and support efficient queries by the election contract that runs on top of the Orbs platform. In order to allow the protocol to evolve in the future, they&#39;ve designed the contract to be migratable, while still requiring participants to provide their agreement for the migration.</p><h3 id="threshold-bls-signature-scheme-security-proof"  class='title-h3'
    >Threshold BLS signature scheme security proof</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>An ongoing <em>Random Beacon</em> project is carried out by members of the research team. In this work, a set of rational players jointly perform a multiparty computation that results in a random number, that can be used in diverse applications. One such notable application is the selection of random committees in Orbs’ consensus mechanism.</p><p  class='text-p'>A cryptographic primitive that naturally appears in this context, is ‘<em>threshold digital signature’</em>; the set of participants sign messages in an incorruptible manner as long as a large portion of them is honest. One manifestation of a threshold digital signature builds upon the well-known (single player) BLS signature scheme. However, security proof of the threshold version of this scheme is not covered in the literature. More specifically, the question raised is whether the devised scheme indeed holds the threshold property, meaning that a (certain specific) portion of players cannot produce a valid signature, while larger sets of players can. Orbs’ Research team has prepared a mathematical proof of security to ensure the security of the threshold version of the BLS signature scheme.</p><h3 id="zero-knowledge"  class='title-h3'
    >Zero-Knowledge</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs core contributors continue to explore the subject of privacy through zero-knowledge proofs, focusing primarily on a few subjects:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Trusted Setup.</strong> Most efficient forms of zero-knowledge proofs require a <em>trusted setup,</em> a subject of controversy, as it entails an expensive procedure and is specified to an application. In other words, different applications (including updates to an application) require different trusted setups. We study zero-knowledge proof systems where the trusted setup only has to be carried out once and is universal in the sense that it supports all applications. These usually come at a price of efficiency, and we focus on mitigating this problem, taking advantage of the efficiency of the Orbs blockchain infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Key generation ceremony.</strong> The generation of keys is a process ideally performed by a trusted party, as leakage of the private keys has severe implications. However, In typical blockchain usually, such a party does not exist. Our team has been studying the procedure to ensure that keys do not leak while avoiding the need for a trusted third party.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="file-systems-and-immutable-large-data-storage"  class='title-h3'
    >File Systems and Immutable Large Data Storage</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs Network aims for accommodating apps that (among others) require large amounts of storage. After all, how would you run a <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-total-size-storage-capacity-of-YouTube-and-at-what-rate-is-it-increasing-How-is-Google-keeping-up-with-the-increasing-demands-of-Youtube%E2%80%99s-capacity-given-that-thousands-of-videos-are-uploaded-every-day" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>distributed YouTube</a> if storage is limited? One direction the research team has taken to explore immutable storage for large data.</p><p  class='text-p'>Part of the research included the reviewing of the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) protocol. IPFS is a distributed peer to peer storage system that has recently gained a lot of interest from various blockchain projects that see IPFS as a good candidate for their protocol’s storage layer (like TrueBit).</p><p  class='text-p'>The research team has been scrutinizing the different components of IPFS in order to learn from them towards a solution tailored particularly for the purpose of the Orbs blockchain infrastructure.</p><p  class='text-p'>Among these components are Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) for fast content lookup and peer locating the network; GIT protocol for version control; block exchange protocol for data swapping marketplace - all may be relevant for the future design of the ever-evolving Orbs infrastructure.</p><p  class='text-p'>A prominent piece that is missing in the original design of IPFS is the incentive layer. When considering distributed storage solutions at scale, with recurrent data reads and writes, there must be an incentive layer that allows nodes to withstand their costs. The FileCoin protocol is designed to complement exactly that. The research team has recently focused on one of FileCoin’s most interesting innovations: Proof-of-Replication (PoRep). PoRep provides an entity with a way to prove that a specific number of replications of a particular file are stored in her local storage system. A distributed file system protocol that is able to absorb the overhead PoRep incurs can solve the problem of data availability, which is one of the major issues when dealing with vast amounts of storage.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Thanks for reading!</strong> I hope this recurring monthly segment is educational and does a great job informing Orbs followers on the R&amp;D happenings.

    >Potential Difficulties</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Naturally, deploying CBDCs involves certain difficulties, especially during the transition phase. Therefore, all relevant authorities and government agencies must be attentive and responsive in order to effectively mitigate issues as they present themselves.</p><p  class='text-p'>Among the potential difficulties we foresee, we expect the impact on the banking industry to be the most significant. As briefly described in prior witings, banks to some extent might experience a liquidity challenge affecting their available credit reserves, thus making credit more expensive through higher interest rates. There could be several paths to alleviate this and increase cash reserves:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Generating new lines of business - The banking industry could undergo a major shakeup as new blockchain-based platforms are deployed, and many traditional (and highly profitable) services will no longer be provided by banks. It will challenge banks to redefine their role in the new economy and to adapt accordingly. While some banks probably see this as a threat, others could use this as an opportunity to grab substantial market share as the demand for new financial services grows. From the general public&#39;s perspective and even the central bank&#39;s, this spur in competition is positive, forcing banks to become more efficient overall.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Central banks are in control of the deposit discount rate, and are therefore in control of the demand for CBDC and for banks&#39; cash reserves. Therefore, the likeliest scenario is one where the central bank will set an interest rate (on CBDC reserves) to reach a new, improved and stable equilibrium. That equilibrium will see only a limited portion of banks&#39; cash reserves flow to CBDC deposits, not most of it and certainly not all of it. As with other similar kinds of economic stabilization measures, it may take some time for the market to readjust, but the market will reach a new and better state, given that the central bank is trusted by the commercial banks</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The role of central banks is to balance several responsibilities in order to maintain a reliable, growing financial market. Providing the option of opening a CBDC account with the central bank makes any person or entity a de facto customer of the central bank. No one actually intends to have them deal directly with the general public, rather they would essentially outsource this service to commercial banks, generating a new line of business and new stream of revenues</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The new CBDC deposit accounts will not be credit facilities. Those will only be provided by commercial banks. Thus banks will focus on offering their customers active financial services rather than just money storage</p></li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>There may be additional difficulties involved in the process of migrating to CBDC, however we will only discuss two more: user privacy and raising sufficient public awareness.</p><p  class='text-p'>Firstly, privacy and anonymity, especially in the context of payment services, will always be a point of contention. On the one hand, many want full domain over their privacy by having the option to use fully anonymous means of payment. On the other hand, such features might be exploited by nefarious actors for illegal activity and tax evasion. As previously noted, CBDCs may provide different levels of user privacy, depending on the central bank&#39;s policy. The most simple solution would be leaving only the lowest value banknotes available, while limiting the allowed value per cash transaction. That would make the transition towards a true cashless economy smoother and quicker. In certain countries, it may even allow policy makers a defense against critics, as not all cash has been abolished.</p><p  class='text-p'>Secondly, getting the public on board may present difficulties. Public awareness campaigns and proper education should mitigate this. We truly believe that any argument that certain parts of the population could not handle this transition and might be victims for potential fraud are patently absurd. Yes, there will be fraudsters and it will take longer for some to &quot;master&quot; the use of digital payments. However, this genuine concern is not reason enough to reject change outright. Had that been the case, there would have been no move to e-banking, internet or mobile devices. Can you imagine our world today without any of them?</p><h3 id="suggested-strategic-outline"  class='title-h3'
    >Suggested Strategic Outline</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In light of the above, and assuming that we have been able to persuade the reader that CBDCs are a powerful instrument that ought to be adopted by central banks, we suggest the following strategy, which calls for a centralized CBDC on a private blockchain protocol but which allows for development into a decentralized protocol - if the technology proves itself to be viable. Deployment would occur in three steps according to this strategy, spread over several years, but starting sooner rather than later. There is no point in indicating the length of each phase, which would be an open question, but we certainly expect a central bank to set reasonable targets on this roadmap and stick to that plan.</p><ol>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 1 - Introducing CBDC Light, for digital payments only. This currency is the light version of the later full-featured centralized CBDC. The general public may open reserve accounts at the central bank, but they will not carry interest and are intended to be used as the central bank&#39;s certified digital wallets. The goal is to introduce the advantages of using digital payment services and reduce the use of cash to a minimum, leaving only the lowest value bills in circulation. This period will allow commercial banks to start getting used to the idea of having a CBDC, knowing that a full-featured CBDC is waiting just around the corner.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 2 - Introducing a full-featured centralized CBDC. Once the public and commercial banks are accustomed to this lighter CBDC, the central bank upgrades it to a full-featured implementation in order to maximize its merits and utilize it as a full monetary instrument. This period involves potential disruptions to the economy, as discussed above. It is up to the central bank to manage the process carefully in order to drive the economy towards its new equilibrium, in which commercial banks are more efficient and generate new revenue streams. In parallel, the central bank during this time closely examines blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets in order to determine when it would be suitable to deploy a decentralized CBDC</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 3 - Discussing decentralization. As noted earlier, we are still not convinced that CBDC decentralization is necessary or ever will be. Still, we urge central banks to think about it, even if just to push the envelope as a thought-experiment, so that as technology advances, they will be in a position to decide if implementation is the correct strategy for them. We are certain that with time, new technology would provide better solutions to problems that we now cannot see being resolved. Central banks should focus their efforts on understanding several key topics which are critical to a decentralized protocol:</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What is the desired level of user privacy and anonymity?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Who are the participating nodes?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>How does the White chain operate?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What are the KYC &amp; AML procedures for opening an account on that chain?</p></li>
</ol>

    >Conclusion</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In this series of posts, we have provided a brief overview of CBDCs and why they should be implemented sooner rather than later. Since CBDCs are such a powerful instrument, their implementation must be calculated and methodical in order to maximize their merits and minimize their demerits.</p><p  class='text-p'>The roles and importance of major actors in our global economy are constantly questioned as we head towards a &#39;new economy&#39;. Each and every one of them will have to adapt to technological innovation in order to maintain relevance and in their position of maintaining market stability. The same goes for central banks. Being the economy&#39;s equivalent of the &quot;responsible adults&quot; in the room, they must engage.</p><p  class='text-p'>We support the recent trend of central banks experimenting and considering issuing a CBDC. In our view, central banks that are looking to lead rather than be led, cannot ignore the potential benefits of this opportunity nor the pitfalls of failing to follow what seems like an inevitable culmination of digital economic innovation over the last two decades.</p></div></div></div></ul></div><div class="footer-tweets"><section class="footer-section-title"><img
