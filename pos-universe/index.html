Therefore, when a Guardian operates a validator node and signs a block, it is backed not just by the Guardian’s own stake, but also by the stake delegated to him. The delegated stake significantly increases the amount of stake that backs the network security and therefore increases applications&#39; trust in its operation. Moreover, the delegated stake plays an important role in preventing network attacks.

Guardians are expected to build a community of Delegators that trust them to truthfully represent their and the network’s interests.</p></section><section class="expending-box-text-more"><p  class='text-p'>Providing the Guardians with the ability to set the level of rewards that will be distributed to their respective Delegators tightens their relationships with their communities. Staking rewards are set by the Guardians, who determine how to split the rewards amongst their Delegators, while a minimum rate of compensation to Guardians is imposed by the protocol.</p><p  class='text-p'>Guardians play an important role in the reward distribution process. A new automated mechanism to set the level of rewards that will be distributed to their Delegators was enabled at the protocol level and featured as part of the updated Guardian interface. The mechanism calculates the amount of rewards that each of the Guardian’s Delegators is entitled to, based on the Delegators’ stake over time and the allocated ratio. A maximum annual reward equal to 12% of total delegated stake is awarded, addressing the tradeoff between an appealing award and sustainable inflation (see Rewards). 1⁄3 of the rewards are guaranteed to the Guardians (i.e., up to 4% annual reward maximum), while the default values for the distribution application grant the remaining 2⁄3 to Delegators (i.e., up to 8% annual reward maximum). The new automated tool allows the Guardians to modify the Delegators’ rewards split.</p><p  class='text-p'>This optimized reward distribution architecture provides a scalable and gas-efficient reward distribution that occurs through the protocol itself. Under this system, once the level of distributions is set by the Guardians, the respective rewards are distributed by the protocol directly to both the Guardians and the Delegators, on a continuous basis. Delegators and Guardians can then decide when they wish to claim their reward tokens.</p><p  class='text-p'>This has multiple important benefits such as added flexibility to the Guardians and Delegators, who may claim the staking rewards at any point in time, significant reduction in costs for Guardians, and more.</p><p  class='text-p'>To learn more about our distribution mechanism, read our documentation​ on <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>GitHub.</a></p></section></div><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-more-btn">+ read more</button><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-less-btn">- read less</button></div></div><div class="expending-box expending-box-border-top" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="expending-box-content"><h4 class="expending-box-title">PoS on Ethereum</h4><div class="expending-box-text"><section class="expending-box-text-full"><p  class='text-p'>Being a hybrid Blockchain, Orbs has always been able to utilize the benefits of both the Orbs PoS architecture along with the benefits of Ethereum - an external objective blockchain for the PoS logic.</p></section><section class="expending-box-text-more"><p  class='text-p'>ORBS token, staking, delegation and voting already operate over Ethereum contracts, utilizing Ethereum’s value as an objective auditor. Thus, the Orbs platform’s architecture runs the core of the election logic on Ethereum. The entire election logic, reward calculation and distribution are carried out using Ethereum contracts, providing multiple advantages.</p><p  class='text-p'>First, it provides a high level of transparency, in particular to light clients. Orbs clients rely on the elected set of validators as the foundation on which applications’ data correctness is based. The ability of any application running on top of Orbs to validate the elected validators set by a simple light client, with no need to constantly audit the election process and PoS logic, is of high value to business applications.</p><p  class='text-p'>Second, as the token, the subscription payments and the staking are performed on Ethereum, a valid state of the elected validator nodes set on Ethereum is required for full automation of Orbs fees and rewards distribution.</p><p  class='text-p'>Third, the PoS over PoW architecture provides additional security to the network. The use of two networks allows the Orbs Network to enjoy the aggregate protection of the combined networks, as any attacker would be required to incur the costs of attacking them both. Specifically, using Ethereum, which has a robust ecosystem whose participants are, in large part, impartial regarding what happens on the Orbs Network, makes it difficult for an attacker to exploit Ethereum to launch an attack on Orbs. The security advantages of this architecture manifest in a variety of ways. For example, it provides a measure against long-range attacks, in which the attacker creates an alternative chain starting with the same genesis block that is indistinguishable from the valid chain, and then misleading users to use the malicious chain. PoS architectures are susceptible to long-range attacks because there is no extra cost to creating long chains, unlike in PoW chains, where creating a long malicious chain would involve intensive computational resources. Thus, PoS typically requires applications to audit all the network traffic in order to validate the current PoS state. Orbs’ architecture avoids this problem by taking advantage of the security provided by Ethereum.</p><p  class='text-p'>Finally, the use of this hybrid architecture ensures the integrity of elections on Orbs, since the Orbs Guardians are not entrusted to process their own election. Processing the elections on the Ethereum network provides an external guarantee that the Orbs Guardians cannot manipulate the election process.</p></section></div><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-more-btn">+ read more</button><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-less-btn">- read less</button></div></div><div class="expending-box expending-box-border-top" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="expending-box-content"><h4 class="expending-box-title">Election Committee</h4><div class="expending-box-text"><section class="expending-box-text-full"><p  class='text-p'>Orbs’ architecture deploys a hybrid model of two committees: General and Certified.
This innovative two-committee approach is introduced to address developers’ needs and reduce their barrier of entry, while maintaining an open and permissionless PoS ecosystem.</p></section><section class="expending-box-text-more"><p  class='text-p'>The first and main committee is the General committee. It comprises the top 22 Guardians with the most delegated stake, whether they have been certified or not. The General committee represents the vast majority of ORBS stake and therefore provides a high quality operation suitable for most applications.</p><p  class='text-p'>In contrast, the Certified committee includes only Guardians who meet certain requirements and have undergone a certification process that includes providing certain identification information. The Certified committee provides a suitable solution for developers with regulatory restrictions that are interested in running applications on a blockchain. Developers may also choose initially to use the Certified committee to reduce friction and transition to the General committee over time.</p></section></div><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-more-btn">+ read more</button><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-less-btn">- read less</button></div></div><div class="expending-box expending-box-border-top" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="expending-box-content"><h4 class="expending-box-title">Rewards, Fees &amp; Bootstrap Fund</h4><div class="expending-box-text"><section class="expending-box-text-full"><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs incentive layer is built to incentivize a maximum overlap between the two committees. A high overlap implies a higher stake backing each committee. Guardians are incentivized to meet the certification requirements and earn additional rewards associated with participation in the certified committee. Certified Guardians are incentivized to accumulate a high stake to enjoy the rewards of the General committee.</p></section><section class="expending-box-text-more"><p  class='text-p'>The fees and rewards in the Orbs PoS architecture serve two important purposes. The first is compensation for operating a validator node. The second is a reward for contributing to network security by staking. The reward model is targeted to award the ones who deserve it - participants that contribute to the network operation and security.</p><p  class='text-p'>Operating a validator node has a cost that includes both computational resources cost and operations cost. Two forms of compensation are designed to cover these costs. First, Virtual Chain fees are paid in the form of Orbs Tokens by the network users who launch a virtual chain. The fees paid for each Virtual Chain are expected to represent the cost with a profit margin. As the network matures and runs more Virtual Chains, the cost per Virtual Chain is expected to be almost constant, representing the cost of the computational resources allocated to the Virtual Chain.This suggests a scalable solution, as the Guardians’ profit increases as the usage increases.</p><p  class='text-p'>In order to incentivize Guardians to participate in the Certified committee by covering their costs, we included an additional bootstrap fund for Guardians who join the Certified committee. This fund is distributed in DAI, pegged to USD, popular in many DeFi applications. It provides profitability even if the token value fluctuates. Furthermore the fund is designed to cover the cost of operating a validator node while running a small number of Virtual Chains during the network early stages. This is important as it provides developers with the ease of mind that the network will continue to operate even under unexpected price fluctuations.</p><p  class='text-p'>A Guardian that operates a validator node and goes through the certification process to participate in the Certified committee will be entitled to receive the annual total of 3000 DAI. This fund provides an incentive for Guardians to participate in the Certified committee, thus increasing the participating stake in this committee and making the network more attractive to app users, while covering the reduced cost of operation as further described in the next episode.</p><p  class='text-p'>Virtual Chain fees and the bootstrap fund are awarded for the operation of validator nodes by Guardians. Therefore, unlike staking rewards, the fees and the bootstrap fund are distributed directly to the Guardians operating the validator nodes. The fees and the bootstrap fund are not staked or shared with the Delegators, allowing the Guardians to utilize them to cover their costs. The fees and the bootstrap fund are awarded for the time period that a Guardian participates in the applicable committee. Once awarded, the rewards can be claimed by the Guardian at any time.</p><p  class='text-p'>Staking rewards are awarded for the stake that elected Guardians and their Delegators allocate to contribute to the network security. It is important to note that <strong>​Only the top 22 elected Guardians are eligible for the rewards, fees and bootstrap funds.</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>A maximum annual reward equal to 12% of total delegated stake is awarded, addressing the tradeoff between an appealing award and sustainable inflation. 1⁄3 of the rewards are guaranteed to the Guardians (i.e., up to 4% annual reward maximum), while the default values for the distribution application grant the remaining 2⁄3 to Delegators (i.e., up to 8% annual reward maximum).</p><p  class='text-p'>The staking reward is capped at 80M ORBS annually. If a larger percentage of ORBS token holders participates, this reward will be allocated pro-rata according to the Guardians’ effective delegated stake. Rewards are calculated continuously based on the effective delegated stake in each time period.</p></section></div><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-more-btn">+ read more</button><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-less-btn">- read less</button></div></div><div class="expending-box expending-box-border-top" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="expending-box-content"><h4 class="expending-box-title">Validator Nodes Streamlining</h4><div class="expending-box-text"><section class="expending-box-text-full"><p  class='text-p'>Orbs PoS Universe significantly reduces the cost of operating and maintaining a validator node on the Orbs Network.

As such, Guardians are required to gain the trust of both the Delegators and the developers that rely on the network with their applications.</p></section><section class="expending-box-text-more"><p  class='text-p'>In order to ensure a secure, available and performant network, Guardians are required to have a commitment to an honest and secure operation of the network. Guardians are also expected to be committed to their communities and their Delegators’ staked tokens. Therefore, Guardians are required to own a personal stake of at least 8% of their total delegated stake. This requirement guarantees a higher level of commitment. A high commitment of the ones operating the validator nodes is most important for adoption by applications and is required by scalable applications.</p><p  class='text-p'>Delegators are expected to select a Guardian that will act on their behalf, maintain the network and distribute their rewards in an honest and timely manner. Delegators are expected to conduct due-diligence regarding their Guardian and select a trustworthy one. Having a minimum self- stake requirement, provides an additional layer of trust, knowing that the Guardian has a “high stake in the game”.</p><p  class='text-p'>A minimum self-stake also contributes to the Guardians’ dynamics and mitigates some potential abuse scenarios. For example, a player with no long-term consideration may try to solicit Delegators by offering an excessive percent of the reward. Such a short-term player may make a profit or gain political power without regard to the potential negative impact on the ecosystem. An attacker may further abuse the delegation by distributing all the rewards and even provide additional funds as a bribe to overcome the network. Minimum self-delegation mitigates such attacks, as a Guardian that abuses the ecosystem is likely to lose the value of his own staked tokens.</p></section></div><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-more-btn">+ read more</button><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-less-btn">- read less</button></div></div><div class="expending-box expending-box-border-top" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="expending-box-content"><h4 class="expending-box-title">Revamped Delegation Mechanism</h4><div class="expending-box-text"><section class="expending-box-text-full"><p  class='text-p'>Delegators are ORBS token holders who assign their voting weight (stake) to Guardians, thereby empowering them to maintain security of the Network and uphold the long term vision of the ecosystem.

In addition, the Orbs team developed TETRA​, a dedicated staking wallet, from which any ORBS holder can easily stake tokens with a Guardian of their choice. Both improvements were widely adopted by the Orbs community.</p><p  class='text-p'>Moreover, Orbs PoS assists in reducing friction for Delegators by allowing for an easy transition of delegation between Guardians through the new staking contract. Delegators can now easily modify their stake between the various Guardians using the new Tetra Wallet, without the need to unstake first.</p><p  class='text-p'>Token holders that delegate to an active Guardian are rewarded in proportion to their stake. Only delegation to an active Guardian that operates a validator node receives rewards. A Guardian that does not fulfill its responsibilities can harm the network and will cause its Delegators to lose their rewards. Therefore, it is imperative for Delegators to monitor their Guardians and make sure that they are fulfilling their responsibilities. The new features described above enable Delegators to efficiently stake to their chosen Guardian, or switch Guardians if necessary, thus helping them fulfill their important role in making the network safe and efficient.</p><p  class='text-p'>Orbs’ rewards assignment and distribution architecture provides Orbs Delegators with an additional level of confidence and predictability for their rewards allocation. Under this architecture, staking rewards are distributed directly to the Orbs Delegators on a continuous basis. This continuous reward assignment allows both Guardians and Delegators to control the rate at which they claim their rewards. Under the new architecture, a Participant can claim their rewards by sending a claim transaction to the contract. This may be done using the Tetra staking interface. As the claim transaction has a gas cost, Delegators may initiate these transactions based on their need and the current gas price, which fluctuates heavily.</p><p  class='text-p'>For more information, read the ​Orbs V2.5 Update documentation.​</p></section></div><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-more-btn">+ read more</button><button aria-label="expend-text" class="expend-btn read-less-btn">- read less</button></div></div></div></div><a href="../white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians" class="link-btn link-btn-right" rel="noopener"><p  class='text-p'>Orbs V2.5 Update documentation</p><aside class="link-btn-arrow"></aside></a></main><div class="subscribe" style="display:none"><section class="subscribe-overlay"></section><form class="subscribe-form form"><button type="button" class="form-close-btn" aria-label="Close"><img src="../assets/img/common/close.svg" alt="close"/></button><h3 class="form-title">SUBSCRIBE FOR UPDATES</h3><div class="form-content flex-column"><div class="form-success" style="background:#191919"><p  class='text-p'>Amazing!

    >Potential Difficulties</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Naturally, deploying CBDCs involves certain difficulties, especially during the transition phase. Therefore, all relevant authorities and government agencies must be attentive and responsive in order to effectively mitigate issues as they present themselves.</p><p  class='text-p'>Among the potential difficulties we foresee, we expect the impact on the banking industry to be the most significant. As briefly described in prior witings, banks to some extent might experience a liquidity challenge affecting their available credit reserves, thus making credit more expensive through higher interest rates. There could be several paths to alleviate this and increase cash reserves:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Generating new lines of business - The banking industry could undergo a major shakeup as new blockchain-based platforms are deployed, and many traditional (and highly profitable) services will no longer be provided by banks. It will challenge banks to redefine their role in the new economy and to adapt accordingly. While some banks probably see this as a threat, others could use this as an opportunity to grab substantial market share as the demand for new financial services grows. From the general public&#39;s perspective and even the central bank&#39;s, this spur in competition is positive, forcing banks to become more efficient overall.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Central banks are in control of the deposit discount rate, and are therefore in control of the demand for CBDC and for banks&#39; cash reserves. Therefore, the likeliest scenario is one where the central bank will set an interest rate (on CBDC reserves) to reach a new, improved and stable equilibrium. That equilibrium will see only a limited portion of banks&#39; cash reserves flow to CBDC deposits, not most of it and certainly not all of it. As with other similar kinds of economic stabilization measures, it may take some time for the market to readjust, but the market will reach a new and better state, given that the central bank is trusted by the commercial banks</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The role of central banks is to balance several responsibilities in order to maintain a reliable, growing financial market. Providing the option of opening a CBDC account with the central bank makes any person or entity a de facto customer of the central bank. No one actually intends to have them deal directly with the general public, rather they would essentially outsource this service to commercial banks, generating a new line of business and new stream of revenues</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The new CBDC deposit accounts will not be credit facilities. Those will only be provided by commercial banks. Thus banks will focus on offering their customers active financial services rather than just money storage</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>There may be additional difficulties involved in the process of migrating to CBDC, however we will only discuss two more: user privacy and raising sufficient public awareness.</p><p  class='text-p'>Firstly, privacy and anonymity, especially in the context of payment services, will always be a point of contention. On the one hand, many want full domain over their privacy by having the option to use fully anonymous means of payment. On the other hand, such features might be exploited by nefarious actors for illegal activity and tax evasion. As previously noted, CBDCs may provide different levels of user privacy, depending on the central bank&#39;s policy. The most simple solution would be leaving only the lowest value banknotes available, while limiting the allowed value per cash transaction. That would make the transition towards a true cashless economy smoother and quicker. In certain countries, it may even allow policy makers a defense against critics, as not all cash has been abolished.</p><p  class='text-p'>Secondly, getting the public on board may present difficulties. Public awareness campaigns and proper education should mitigate this. We truly believe that any argument that certain parts of the population could not handle this transition and might be victims for potential fraud are patently absurd. Yes, there will be fraudsters and it will take longer for some to &quot;master&quot; the use of digital payments. However, this genuine concern is not reason enough to reject change outright. Had that been the case, there would have been no move to e-banking, internet or mobile devices. Can you imagine our world today without any of them?</p><h3 id="suggested-strategic-outline"  class='title-h3'
    >Suggested Strategic Outline</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In light of the above, and assuming that we have been able to persuade the reader that CBDCs are a powerful instrument that ought to be adopted by central banks, we suggest the following strategy, which calls for a centralized CBDC on a private blockchain protocol but which allows for development into a decentralized protocol - if the technology proves itself to be viable. Deployment would occur in three steps according to this strategy, spread over several years, but starting sooner rather than later. There is no point in indicating the length of each phase, which would be an open question, but we certainly expect a central bank to set reasonable targets on this roadmap and stick to that plan.</p><ol>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 1 - Introducing CBDC Light, for digital payments only. This currency is the light version of the later full-featured centralized CBDC. The general public may open reserve accounts at the central bank, but they will not carry interest and are intended to be used as the central bank&#39;s certified digital wallets. The goal is to introduce the advantages of using digital payment services and reduce the use of cash to a minimum, leaving only the lowest value bills in circulation. This period will allow commercial banks to start getting used to the idea of having a CBDC, knowing that a full-featured CBDC is waiting just around the corner.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 2 - Introducing a full-featured centralized CBDC. Once the public and commercial banks are accustomed to this lighter CBDC, the central bank upgrades it to a full-featured implementation in order to maximize its merits and utilize it as a full monetary instrument. This period involves potential disruptions to the economy, as discussed above. It is up to the central bank to manage the process carefully in order to drive the economy towards its new equilibrium, in which commercial banks are more efficient and generate new revenue streams. In parallel, the central bank during this time closely examines blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets in order to determine when it would be suitable to deploy a decentralized CBDC</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 3 - Discussing decentralization. As noted earlier, we are still not convinced that CBDC decentralization is necessary or ever will be. Still, we urge central banks to think about it, even if just to push the envelope as a thought-experiment, so that as technology advances, they will be in a position to decide if implementation is the correct strategy for them. We are certain that with time, new technology would provide better solutions to problems that we now cannot see being resolved. Central banks should focus their efforts on understanding several key topics which are critical to a decentralized protocol:</p></li>

    >Conclusion</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In this series of posts, we have provided a brief overview of CBDCs and why they should be implemented sooner rather than later. Since CBDCs are such a powerful instrument, their implementation must be calculated and methodical in order to maximize their merits and minimize their demerits.</p><p  class='text-p'>The roles and importance of major actors in our global economy are constantly questioned as we head towards a &#39;new economy&#39;. Each and every one of them will have to adapt to technological innovation in order to maintain relevance and in their position of maintaining market stability. The same goes for central banks. Being the economy&#39;s equivalent of the &quot;responsible adults&quot; in the room, they must engage.</p><p  class='text-p'>We support the recent trend of central banks experimenting and considering issuing a CBDC. In our view, central banks that are looking to lead rather than be led, cannot ignore the potential benefits of this opportunity nor the pitfalls of failing to follow what seems like an inevitable culmination of digital economic innovation over the last two decades.</p></div></div></div></ul></div><div class="footer-tweets"><section class="footer-section-title"><img
