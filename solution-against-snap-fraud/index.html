    >About SNAP</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the name of the formerly known Food Stamp Program. It is the US Department of Agriculture’s largest program, in terms of both money spent and number of recipients<a href="../#_ftn1" rel="noopener">[1]</a>. It provides food purchasing assistance to low income Americans. According to USDA’s data<a href="../#_ftn2" rel="noopener">[2]</a>, approximately 40 Million individuals of 20 Million households received SNAP in Fiscal Year 2018. The total cost to the US taxpayer is estimated at $65 Billion that year and the average monthly payout was about $125 per participant. Combining these with US household data<a href="../#_ftn3" rel="noopener">[3]</a>, suggests that 15.5%<a href="../#_ftn4" rel="noopener">[4]</a> of US households received SNAP support at some point in 2018. Astounding as it may be, it is still an improvement compared to 17.3% and 16.6% in Fiscal Years 2016 and 2017, accordingly, as shown in Table 1:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/solution-against-snap-fraud/Table-Individuals-households-and-total-Cost-of-SNAP-2016-2018-1030x282.png" alt="Table 1: Individuals, households and total Cost of SNAP 2016-2018"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Participants in the program are issued with an Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card which functions like an ordinary debit card, except that it can only be used to purchase authorized food items at specific retailers approved by SNAP. The EBT is recharged on a monthly basis with the amount that the participating household is eligible for.</p><h3 id="snap-fraud"  class='title-h3'
    >SNAP Fraud</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The most common abuse of SNAP is referred to as “trafficking”. It means an exchange of SNAP benefits for cash, unapproved items or other goods (<em>e.g.</em> controlled substances, firearms, ammunition, etc.). In some cases SNAP participants give away their EBT card in exchange for these benefits and then report that it is missing, in order to have a new one issued instead. Certain SNAP participants have outdone it by simply listing their EBTs on eBay and Craigslist<a href="../#_ftn5" rel="noopener">[5]</a>. In other cases, retailers are actively participating in the fraud. In those cases they usually charge the EBT with a certain amount in return for a discounted cash amount, or just overcharge the participant that is looking to purchase unapproved items.</p><p  class='text-p'>According to the recent SNAP State Activity Report<a href="../#_ftn6" rel="noopener">[6]</a>, $592.7 Million were determined by investigations as “Fraud Dollars” in 2016. One may assume that the amount suspected as fraud, though not “determined by investigations”, was higher. Thes “Fraud Dollars” stand for 0.8% of the overall cost of SNAP that year. While it may be debatable whether 0.8% of fraud is high or not, $592.7 Million of taxpayers money is a lot.</p><p  class='text-p'>This poses a double problem. First and foremost, families in need, especially those with children, or disabled or elderly participants, are deprived of the nutritional assistance they were intended to receive. Secondly, this malfunction motivates fraudulent activities on the expense of the federal aid funds.</p><h3 id="is-fraud-the-real-problem-with-us-social-programs-"  class='title-h3'
    >Is Fraud the Real Problem with US Social Programs?</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>It seems that SNAP fraud is frequently highlighted in the media, usually, in response to government campaigns warning against it and trying to stop it. Still, is fraud the <em>real</em> problem of US welfare programs?</p><p  class='text-p'>There are various federal and state social programs in the US. Each serves a unique purpose for meeting different basic needs, <em>e.g.</em> housing (Section 8 Housing), healthcare (Medicaid), nutrition (SNAP), cash assistance (TANF) and others. Different executive departments are responsible for different programs, with no single entity overlooking national welfare as a whole. This results in at least two undesired outcomes:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Bureaucratic overhead:</strong> Each program has to support its own administration. While it is difficult to determine to what extent each program’s administration overlaps with the others, it would be safe to assume that merging at least some of the overlapping divisions within these administrations under the responsibility of a single entity would improve overall efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Suboptimal national welfare assistance:</strong> Each program sets its own eligibility requirements. In order to receive the benefits of different programs, individuals are required to apply <em>separately</em> for each program. Multiple studies<a href="../#_ftn7" rel="noopener">[7]</a><a href="../#_ftn8" rel="noopener">[8]</a><a href="../#_ftn9" rel="noopener">[9]</a><a href="../#_ftn10" rel="noopener">[10]</a> suggest that this results in <em>eligible</em> individuals not applying for welfare due to the red tape involved, thus not getting the full support they should have. The result is a national welfare program that is not as efficient as it could and should be.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>It might be overly optimistic to assume that such an entity will be established any time soon in the US. However, a first step towards improving overall efficiency should be sharing some information across social programs and relevant executive departments. It can both decrease some of the bureaucratic overlap by improving data transparency and make it a lot easier for individuals to apply for different programs under this unified database.</p><h3 id="outlines-for-a-blockchain-based-solution"  class='title-h3'
    >Outlines for a Blockchain-based Solution</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In a nutshell, blockchain technology allows safe interactions between parties who do not necessarily trust each other. An example for such interaction is selective sharing of relevant information across multiple participating entities in the network. With regard to US welfare programs, this allows each participant in social program(s) to create her own digital identity (containing all her relevant personal details) combined with a cryptographic digital wallet, and share this information selectively with different programs, only as required. Naturally, this calls for the highest standards of data privacy, which will be discussed later on in this post.</p><h4 id="the-platform-works-as-follows-"  class='title-h4'
    >The platform works as follows:</h4>
<ul>
<li>John Smith plans on applying for a certain social program. For that purpose, he generates a digital ID and securely uploads all required documents. In addition, a set of digital wallet addresses is generated for John’s future use.</li>
<li>The application process is straightforward and requires John to provide a secure access to his digital ID to the program administration.</li>
<li>The program administration then determines whether he is eligible or not for the benefits. Upon his approval as eligible, one of his digital addresses is automatically assigned for receiving the benefits.</li>
<li>In addition, the approval means that his digital ID (<em>e</em> the documents he uploaded) is authenticated by a social program and can later be used for an easy application to any other social programs.</li>
<li>An <em>automated</em> process updates John from time to time on his eligibility for additional programs. Upon a match, John can simply apply for other program, by simply sharing his <em>already</em> authenticated digital ID.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Given that certain programs already provide benefits through EBT, the transition to a cryptographic digital wallet will be simplified. In fact, the participants will not notice any difference in their day-to-day use of EBT. Having said that, in order to maximize overall efficiency, more (and eventually all) programs should use the new cryptographic EBT with time. There are several advantages for the cryptographic wallet:</p><ul>
<li>It allows generating multiple addresses, all under the same master wallet, each for a different social program, if required</li>
<li>As additional programs use EBT, its importance increases for the participants. As a direct result, it is less likely that those individuals will tend to illegally exchange them for cash, thus a positive externality may be reduced SNAP trafficking</li>
<li>Lastly, as far-fetched as it may be right now, these cryptographic EBT wallets may possible serve as alternative bank accounts for individuals receiving social benefits and who are considered as “unbankable”</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Naturally, this is merely a general concept at a very preliminary phase.</p><h3 id="user-privacy"  class='title-h3'
    >User Privacy</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The cornerstone of this conceptual platform is the guarantee of user privacy. Consequently, certain aspects in our suggested platform require special attention. Both aspects are mandatory for providing sufficient privacy:</p><ul>
<li>User identity - no documents will be stored on the platform, only their hashes will. This allows unequivocal authentication and user identification, without exposing <em>any</em> of the participant’s personal details. We will not go into the technicalities of hash functions herein.</li>
<li>Transaction anonymity - this part is a bit more complicated. We identify two types of users:<ul>
<li>Program administrations, who must get access to transaction details of their participants, in order to transfer benefits and enforce policy, <em>g.</em> which food items can or cannot be purchased, which retailers are part of the program or not, etc.</li>
<li>All other users, who should not get any type of other participants’ transaction data</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>This can be carried out using certain privacy protocols that mask the participant’s transaction in a way that only certain users can track it.</p><p  class='text-p'>Another aspect that we will not delve into at this point, but also requires attention, is improving EBT and digital ID access security. Obviously, the card itself along with the PIN code are not secure enough and as more programs use the new EBT, additional measures will be required to ensure they are not hacked. We have some concepts for overcoming this, and will further discuss them in future posts.</p><h2 id="conclusion"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Conclusion</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>There is no doubt that SNAP fraud is a hot topic that provokes a wider debate on US welfare program. In my opinion, a more interesting debate should focus on whether this is the <em>main</em> problem of the US welfare program. Either way, while the concept of a new blockchain-based solution might seem at first groundbreaking, in many key aspects it is based on upgrading current infrastructure (EBT) combined with new concepts (Digital ID). We consider it as another example in which blockchain technology inspires us to think outside the box about new solutions to old problems. In this particular case it may even kill two birds with one stone - both improving US welfare and curtailing fraud.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'>Hexa Foundation is a non-profit organization focused on using blockchain to create social impact.

    >Potential Difficulties</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Naturally, deploying CBDCs involves certain difficulties, especially during the transition phase. Therefore, all relevant authorities and government agencies must be attentive and responsive in order to effectively mitigate issues as they present themselves.</p><p  class='text-p'>Among the potential difficulties we foresee, we expect the impact on the banking industry to be the most significant. As briefly described in prior witings, banks to some extent might experience a liquidity challenge affecting their available credit reserves, thus making credit more expensive through higher interest rates. There could be several paths to alleviate this and increase cash reserves:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Generating new lines of business - The banking industry could undergo a major shakeup as new blockchain-based platforms are deployed, and many traditional (and highly profitable) services will no longer be provided by banks. It will challenge banks to redefine their role in the new economy and to adapt accordingly. While some banks probably see this as a threat, others could use this as an opportunity to grab substantial market share as the demand for new financial services grows. From the general public&#39;s perspective and even the central bank&#39;s, this spur in competition is positive, forcing banks to become more efficient overall.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Central banks are in control of the deposit discount rate, and are therefore in control of the demand for CBDC and for banks&#39; cash reserves. Therefore, the likeliest scenario is one where the central bank will set an interest rate (on CBDC reserves) to reach a new, improved and stable equilibrium. That equilibrium will see only a limited portion of banks&#39; cash reserves flow to CBDC deposits, not most of it and certainly not all of it. As with other similar kinds of economic stabilization measures, it may take some time for the market to readjust, but the market will reach a new and better state, given that the central bank is trusted by the commercial banks</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The role of central banks is to balance several responsibilities in order to maintain a reliable, growing financial market. Providing the option of opening a CBDC account with the central bank makes any person or entity a de facto customer of the central bank. No one actually intends to have them deal directly with the general public, rather they would essentially outsource this service to commercial banks, generating a new line of business and new stream of revenues</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The new CBDC deposit accounts will not be credit facilities. Those will only be provided by commercial banks. Thus banks will focus on offering their customers active financial services rather than just money storage</p></li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>There may be additional difficulties involved in the process of migrating to CBDC, however we will only discuss two more: user privacy and raising sufficient public awareness.</p><p  class='text-p'>Firstly, privacy and anonymity, especially in the context of payment services, will always be a point of contention. On the one hand, many want full domain over their privacy by having the option to use fully anonymous means of payment. On the other hand, such features might be exploited by nefarious actors for illegal activity and tax evasion. As previously noted, CBDCs may provide different levels of user privacy, depending on the central bank&#39;s policy. The most simple solution would be leaving only the lowest value banknotes available, while limiting the allowed value per cash transaction. That would make the transition towards a true cashless economy smoother and quicker. In certain countries, it may even allow policy makers a defense against critics, as not all cash has been abolished.</p><p  class='text-p'>Secondly, getting the public on board may present difficulties. Public awareness campaigns and proper education should mitigate this. We truly believe that any argument that certain parts of the population could not handle this transition and might be victims for potential fraud are patently absurd. Yes, there will be fraudsters and it will take longer for some to &quot;master&quot; the use of digital payments. However, this genuine concern is not reason enough to reject change outright. Had that been the case, there would have been no move to e-banking, internet or mobile devices. Can you imagine our world today without any of them?</p><h3 id="suggested-strategic-outline"  class='title-h3'
    >Suggested Strategic Outline</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In light of the above, and assuming that we have been able to persuade the reader that CBDCs are a powerful instrument that ought to be adopted by central banks, we suggest the following strategy, which calls for a centralized CBDC on a private blockchain protocol but which allows for development into a decentralized protocol - if the technology proves itself to be viable. Deployment would occur in three steps according to this strategy, spread over several years, but starting sooner rather than later. There is no point in indicating the length of each phase, which would be an open question, but we certainly expect a central bank to set reasonable targets on this roadmap and stick to that plan.</p><ol>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 1 - Introducing CBDC Light, for digital payments only. This currency is the light version of the later full-featured centralized CBDC. The general public may open reserve accounts at the central bank, but they will not carry interest and are intended to be used as the central bank&#39;s certified digital wallets. The goal is to introduce the advantages of using digital payment services and reduce the use of cash to a minimum, leaving only the lowest value bills in circulation. This period will allow commercial banks to start getting used to the idea of having a CBDC, knowing that a full-featured CBDC is waiting just around the corner.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 2 - Introducing a full-featured centralized CBDC. Once the public and commercial banks are accustomed to this lighter CBDC, the central bank upgrades it to a full-featured implementation in order to maximize its merits and utilize it as a full monetary instrument. This period involves potential disruptions to the economy, as discussed above. It is up to the central bank to manage the process carefully in order to drive the economy towards its new equilibrium, in which commercial banks are more efficient and generate new revenue streams. In parallel, the central bank during this time closely examines blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets in order to determine when it would be suitable to deploy a decentralized CBDC</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 3 - Discussing decentralization. As noted earlier, we are still not convinced that CBDC decentralization is necessary or ever will be. Still, we urge central banks to think about it, even if just to push the envelope as a thought-experiment, so that as technology advances, they will be in a position to decide if implementation is the correct strategy for them. We are certain that with time, new technology would provide better solutions to problems that we now cannot see being resolved. Central banks should focus their efforts on understanding several key topics which are critical to a decentralized protocol:</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What is the desired level of user privacy and anonymity?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Who are the participating nodes?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>How does the White chain operate?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What are the KYC &amp; AML procedures for opening an account on that chain?</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion"  class='title-h3'
    >Conclusion</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In this series of posts, we have provided a brief overview of CBDCs and why they should be implemented sooner rather than later. Since CBDCs are such a powerful instrument, their implementation must be calculated and methodical in order to maximize their merits and minimize their demerits.</p><p  class='text-p'>The roles and importance of major actors in our global economy are constantly questioned as we head towards a &#39;new economy&#39;. Each and every one of them will have to adapt to technological innovation in order to maintain relevance and in their position of maintaining market stability. The same goes for central banks. Being the economy&#39;s equivalent of the &quot;responsible adults&quot; in the room, they must engage.</p><p  class='text-p'>We support the recent trend of central banks experimenting and considering issuing a CBDC. In our view, central banks that are looking to lead rather than be led, cannot ignore the potential benefits of this opportunity nor the pitfalls of failing to follow what seems like an inevitable culmination of digital economic innovation over the last two decades.</p></div></div></div></ul></div><div class="footer-tweets"><section class="footer-section-title"><img
