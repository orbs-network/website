With a long pause for philanthropic and government work, eventually, I found my way to blockchain and now I spend my days writing about DeFi vs CeFi. Some of my old Wall Street friends still run a lot of money in hedge funds, and while in 2018 they would tease me and ask if I was still ‘doing my crypto thing’, even today some of them still think that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme. One of my dearest friend’s from my past days in finance recently sent me Paul Krugman’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/20/opinion/cryptocurrency-bitcoin.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>NYT opinion column on Bitcoin</a>, as afurther argument to the fake world of crypto, so I took up the challenge to answer Paul’s claims:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/response-to-krugmans-column-in-nyt/img1.png" alt="img"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>It is clear that Krugman doesn’t think highly of cryptocurrencies. It was clear in 2013 with his initial piece in the New York Times, titled <a href="https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/bitcoin-is-evil/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Bitcoin is Evil</a> (I sure hope he has not been short this entire time!).</p><p  class='text-p'>But actually, I can see where he is coming from and, to be honest, I can think of so many aspects in which cryptocurrencies need to improve. Having said that, repeating the same old tired cliches such as: “Bitcoin is only good for illegal activities” or “there is no real use for Bitcoin in real life” does not cut it anymore in 2021. Respectfully, I will say that I was hoping for more from a Nobel Laureate in Economics. Krugman starts off by comparing Bitcoin’s so-called lack of progress during the past 12 years, since its inception, to other technologies such as Venmo the iPad or Zoom that have thrived and become major parts of our lives. Well, let’s begin by examining Bitcoin’s public exposure – what started out as an ultra-niche software (sorry, Satoshi) grew into a $1 trillion asset class (at its peak) as the graph below shows, faster than any other asset, and has become one of the hottest research topics in leading central and commercial banks as well as tech companies all around the world. Not to mention the topic of multiple US Senate (and other parliaments) hearings concerning its regulation and economic impact. However, what’s even more interesting is that Krugman completely ignores the fact that this progress has occurred despite multiple governments’ repeated attempts to fight Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/response-to-krugmans-column-in-nyt/img2.png" alt="img"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>In my opinion, the resilience of a government’s sovereignty can be measured in two major factors: its national security and economy. What can be a better metric of economic resilience than a currency? Krugman in the past has claimed that <a href="https://consultingbyrpm.com/blog/2013/12/krugman-fiat-money-is-backed-by-men-with-guns.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>“Fiat Money…Is Backed By Men With Guns”</a>, which may explain why in this article he ignores the fact that most governments perceive cryptocurrencies as a direct threat to their own currency, and as a result, they try to combat them. Some try to ban crypto while others refrain from establishing a clear regulatory framework. This reason alone could explain why cryptocurrencies still have not become part of our everyday life.</p><p  class='text-p'>Krugman goes on with the weak argument that he has never heard a clear answer for the simple question – what is a cryptocurrency and/or blockchain good for?</p><p  class='text-p'>First, I am puzzled by this oxymoron because – cryptocurrency is a use case of blockchain, and also because Satoshi gave a very clear answer in 2008 to this question (Bitcoin is here to replace Central Bank Fiat money). But this, I am sure Krugman has had the chance to discuss with the most knowledgeable and intelligent blockchain and crypto experts out there.</p><p  class='text-p'>I will admit that other use cases for blockchain (other than finance) are not easy to come by, and that it could be that he was not convinced by the potential that perfect transparency and inclusion, provided by blockchain, can have on better <a href="../improving-supply-chain-with-blockchain" rel="noopener">supply chain management</a>, <a href="../how-president-macron-can-really-bring-change-to-foreign-aid" rel="noopener">financial and aid funds control</a>, fighting corruption through cleaner public procurement platforms, <a href="../what-elite-capture-means-and-why-it-should-enrage-you" rel="noopener">eliminating elite capture</a>, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/10/how-blockchain-could-help-crack-down-on-abusive-imagery/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>fighting proliferation of minors’ abusive imagery</a> and more. Yet, I cannot comprehend how Krugman can overlook cryptocurrencies’ impact on the people living under crumbling economies, such as in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47553048" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Venezuela</a>, or their potential to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F7JaDK--x20MsHGY1d_kBZJ2i4eLTxIXU4spHQDfCh4/edit" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>save billions of dollars in migrants’ remittance fees.</a></p><p  class='text-p'><a href="../how-president-macron-can-really-bring-change-to-foreign-aid" rel="noopener"><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/response-to-krugmans-column-in-nyt/img3.jpeg" alt="img"></figure></a></p><p  class='text-p'>Instead, Krugman suggests that cryptocurrencies may just be the most current Ponzi scheme, spiced with “tecnobabble” and “liberterian derp”, adding at the same breath, that so is gold… In fact, Krugman sees the two as similar – “Gold, after all, suffers from pretty much the same problems as Bitcoin.” In many circles, Bitcoin is referred to as “digital gold”. Funnily enough, I cannot think of a better supporting argument crypto believers could have hoped for, other than Krugman’s quote. He later glorifies gold’s “mystique” and “semi-sacred status”, claiming that cryptocurrencies may never get to that. Maybe he is right, however he does not explain how he reached this interesting conclusion. So in essence this argument is the equivalent of knowing for a fact that chocolate ice cream tastes better than vanilla.</p><p  class='text-p'>Last but not least, I wanted to address Krugman and others’ repeated argument that Bitcoin is closely associated with illegal activities, and whose Pavlovian conditioning to cryptocurrencies summons ransomware, drug trafficking and money laundering:</p><p  class='text-p'>Yes, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been, and still are, used by bad actors to finance their illegal activities. But by the way, so are cash, gold and bank accounts. In this piece, I explain how Bitcoin actually is better suited to help law enforcement prevent illegal financial activities than fiat.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="../why-trump-should-want-everyone-using-bitcoin-including-bad-guys" rel="noopener"><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/response-to-krugmans-column-in-nyt/img4.jpeg" alt="img"></figure></a></p><p  class='text-p'>Allow me to go out on a limb and say: most owners or users of cryptocurrencies are not criminals. They are law-abiding citizens, wherever on the globe they may be. It is the lack of clear regulations that exacerbates issues. Not only does lack of regulation fail to block all the legal loopholes that bad actors exploit, but it also prevents most users from having clear guidance as to what they can and cannot do, thus putting everybody in the same bucket as alleged criminals. In my opinion, regulators must react faster and regulate crypto markets sooner rather than <a href="../when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system" rel="noopener">later</a>. Some work hard to reach that goal, but most of them are not doing enough.</p><p  class='text-p'>While Krugman and I hold differing views on Bitcoin, blockchain, and their value add to the world, we do agree on one thing – they are here to stay. The more these topics are discussed and shared regardless of different opinions, the more people are exposed to the matter, learn about it and form their independent opinions. This is how concepts evolve. Actually, the fact that such a highly respected Nobel Prize recipient and economist writes an opinion column about Bitcoin in one of the world’s most popular newspapers – twice – proves the impact that cryptocurrencies have on our lives, and may have on our future. For us true believers, the potential impact and good that this technology can create in the future is reason enough to HODL.</p><div class='line-separator'></div>

Simply select ORBS from the token pull down menu and then select the AVAX mainnet as the destination chain.</p><p  class='text-p'>AnySwap can also be used to <a href="https://www.orbs.com/orbs-is-now-live-on-binance-smart-chain-via-anyswap-cross-chain-bridge/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>bridge</a> ORBS tokens onto the BSC network, thereby making it a three-way bridge enabling Orbs token holders to move ORBS between the Ethereum, Avalanche and BSC chains!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/AnySwap-Avalanche/img2.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>You can find the bridged ORBS token contract on AVAX here:</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://avascan.info/blockchain/c/token/0x340fE1D898ECCAad394e2ba0fC1F93d27c7b717A" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://avascan.info/blockchain/c/token/0x340fE1D898ECCAad394e2ba0fC1F93d27c7b717A</a></p><p  class='text-p'>As always, exercise caution when working with 3rd party technologies, educate yourself regarding the risks involved and read all <a href="https://github.com/anyswap/Anyswap-Audit/blob/master/SlowMist/AnySwap%20CrossChain-Bridge%20Security%20Audit%20Report.pdf" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>security audits</a>.</p><h3 id="no-stopping-the-orbs-avalanche"  class='title-h3'
    >No Stopping the Orbs Avalanche</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>As we discussed in our <a href="https://www.orbs.com/Orbs-Coming-to-Avalanche/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>latest</a> blog post, Orbs has targeted Avalanche as its next avenue for expansion, being one of the fastest growing Layer-1 chains with over $3.17B in TVL!</p><p  class='text-p'>The Avalanche ecosystem is exploding, following the launch of an impressive $180M grant program, with over <a href="https://ecosystem.avax.network/marketplace?tag=" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>140 ecosystem partners</a> and more than <a href="https://www.avax-projects.com/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>320 projects</a> building on its blockchain. Some of these include major players like SushiSwap, Chainlink, Circle and the Graph.</p><p  class='text-p'>With this latest integration, Orbs is now live on all 5 major L-1 chains: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Solana, and now - Avalanche. This in turn accelerated the integration of the Orbs ecosystem with over 17 major DeFi protocols (such as UniSwap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, Kyber Networks, 1inch, Alpaca Finance, Beefy Finance, QuickSwap, DinoSwap, with more to come soon...)</p><p  class='text-p'>Orbs unique features designed for interoperability primarily with EVM-compatible blockchains, together with its decentralized network of nodes, gives it a competitive advantage in various DeFi applications.</p><p  class='text-p'>We are very excited about tapping the potential of Orbs in the DeFi space. Orbs multi-chain integration plays a critical role in this initiative. Already we are seeing applications of amazing innovative projects being developed on Orbs.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Expect more to come in the near future!</strong></p><div class='line-separator'></div>

    >Potential Difficulties</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Naturally, deploying CBDCs involves certain difficulties, especially during the transition phase. Therefore, all relevant authorities and government agencies must be attentive and responsive in order to effectively mitigate issues as they present themselves.</p><p  class='text-p'>Among the potential difficulties we foresee, we expect the impact on the banking industry to be the most significant. As briefly described in prior witings, banks to some extent might experience a liquidity challenge affecting their available credit reserves, thus making credit more expensive through higher interest rates. There could be several paths to alleviate this and increase cash reserves:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Generating new lines of business - The banking industry could undergo a major shakeup as new blockchain-based platforms are deployed, and many traditional (and highly profitable) services will no longer be provided by banks. It will challenge banks to redefine their role in the new economy and to adapt accordingly. While some banks probably see this as a threat, others could use this as an opportunity to grab substantial market share as the demand for new financial services grows. From the general public&#39;s perspective and even the central bank&#39;s, this spur in competition is positive, forcing banks to become more efficient overall.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Central banks are in control of the deposit discount rate, and are therefore in control of the demand for CBDC and for banks&#39; cash reserves. Therefore, the likeliest scenario is one where the central bank will set an interest rate (on CBDC reserves) to reach a new, improved and stable equilibrium. That equilibrium will see only a limited portion of banks&#39; cash reserves flow to CBDC deposits, not most of it and certainly not all of it. As with other similar kinds of economic stabilization measures, it may take some time for the market to readjust, but the market will reach a new and better state, given that the central bank is trusted by the commercial banks</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The role of central banks is to balance several responsibilities in order to maintain a reliable, growing financial market. Providing the option of opening a CBDC account with the central bank makes any person or entity a de facto customer of the central bank. No one actually intends to have them deal directly with the general public, rather they would essentially outsource this service to commercial banks, generating a new line of business and new stream of revenues</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The new CBDC deposit accounts will not be credit facilities. Those will only be provided by commercial banks. Thus banks will focus on offering their customers active financial services rather than just money storage</p></li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>There may be additional difficulties involved in the process of migrating to CBDC, however we will only discuss two more: user privacy and raising sufficient public awareness.</p><p  class='text-p'>Firstly, privacy and anonymity, especially in the context of payment services, will always be a point of contention. On the one hand, many want full domain over their privacy by having the option to use fully anonymous means of payment. On the other hand, such features might be exploited by nefarious actors for illegal activity and tax evasion. As previously noted, CBDCs may provide different levels of user privacy, depending on the central bank&#39;s policy. The most simple solution would be leaving only the lowest value banknotes available, while limiting the allowed value per cash transaction. That would make the transition towards a true cashless economy smoother and quicker. In certain countries, it may even allow policy makers a defense against critics, as not all cash has been abolished.</p><p  class='text-p'>Secondly, getting the public on board may present difficulties. Public awareness campaigns and proper education should mitigate this. We truly believe that any argument that certain parts of the population could not handle this transition and might be victims for potential fraud are patently absurd. Yes, there will be fraudsters and it will take longer for some to &quot;master&quot; the use of digital payments. However, this genuine concern is not reason enough to reject change outright. Had that been the case, there would have been no move to e-banking, internet or mobile devices. Can you imagine our world today without any of them?</p><h3 id="suggested-strategic-outline"  class='title-h3'
    >Suggested Strategic Outline</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In light of the above, and assuming that we have been able to persuade the reader that CBDCs are a powerful instrument that ought to be adopted by central banks, we suggest the following strategy, which calls for a centralized CBDC on a private blockchain protocol but which allows for development into a decentralized protocol - if the technology proves itself to be viable. Deployment would occur in three steps according to this strategy, spread over several years, but starting sooner rather than later. There is no point in indicating the length of each phase, which would be an open question, but we certainly expect a central bank to set reasonable targets on this roadmap and stick to that plan.</p><ol>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 1 - Introducing CBDC Light, for digital payments only. This currency is the light version of the later full-featured centralized CBDC. The general public may open reserve accounts at the central bank, but they will not carry interest and are intended to be used as the central bank&#39;s certified digital wallets. The goal is to introduce the advantages of using digital payment services and reduce the use of cash to a minimum, leaving only the lowest value bills in circulation. This period will allow commercial banks to start getting used to the idea of having a CBDC, knowing that a full-featured CBDC is waiting just around the corner.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 2 - Introducing a full-featured centralized CBDC. Once the public and commercial banks are accustomed to this lighter CBDC, the central bank upgrades it to a full-featured implementation in order to maximize its merits and utilize it as a full monetary instrument. This period involves potential disruptions to the economy, as discussed above. It is up to the central bank to manage the process carefully in order to drive the economy towards its new equilibrium, in which commercial banks are more efficient and generate new revenue streams. In parallel, the central bank during this time closely examines blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets in order to determine when it would be suitable to deploy a decentralized CBDC</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 3 - Discussing decentralization. As noted earlier, we are still not convinced that CBDC decentralization is necessary or ever will be. Still, we urge central banks to think about it, even if just to push the envelope as a thought-experiment, so that as technology advances, they will be in a position to decide if implementation is the correct strategy for them. We are certain that with time, new technology would provide better solutions to problems that we now cannot see being resolved. Central banks should focus their efforts on understanding several key topics which are critical to a decentralized protocol:</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What is the desired level of user privacy and anonymity?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Who are the participating nodes?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>How does the White chain operate?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What are the KYC &amp; AML procedures for opening an account on that chain?</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion"  class='title-h3'
    >Conclusion</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In this series of posts, we have provided a brief overview of CBDCs and why they should be implemented sooner rather than later. Since CBDCs are such a powerful instrument, their implementation must be calculated and methodical in order to maximize their merits and minimize their demerits.</p><p  class='text-p'>The roles and importance of major actors in our global economy are constantly questioned as we head towards a &#39;new economy&#39;. Each and every one of them will have to adapt to technological innovation in order to maintain relevance and in their position of maintaining market stability. The same goes for central banks. Being the economy&#39;s equivalent of the &quot;responsible adults&quot; in the room, they must engage.</p><p  class='text-p'>We support the recent trend of central banks experimenting and considering issuing a CBDC. In our view, central banks that are looking to lead rather than be led, cannot ignore the potential benefits of this opportunity nor the pitfalls of failing to follow what seems like an inevitable culmination of digital economic innovation over the last two decades.</p></div></div></div></ul></div><div class="footer-tweets"><section class="footer-section-title"><img
