Ran Melamed, Head of Research at the Hexa Foundation, detailed our thoughts on CBDCs.  In this second post on the topic, we discuss the advantages of deploying <a href="https://98485716-4f63-4760-97b8-9800c57425f8.filesusr.com/ugd/36247c_7888d2661fb34ac18fe605d965c5cd1e.pdf" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>CBDCs</a>, as an effective instrument for tackling the multiple economical challenges and trends. We focus on the following:</p><ul>
<li>Using this new monetary tool to adjust discount rates</li>
<li>Reducing the amount of circulated cash </li>
<li>Driving Competition in Banking Industry</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>CBDCs’ key advantage is providing central banks an additional and powerful monetary tool. Adjusting interest rates is a central bank’s most powerful instrument for carrying out monetary policy. These adjustments have a direct effect on macroeconomic factors such as the commercial bank’s liquidity and credit cost, and as a result consumer spending and borrowing. According to conventional monetary theory, a central bank has three conventional means to affect a market’s interest rate:</p><ul>
<li>Open market operations (OMO) – Buying or issuing bonds, to increase or decrease the total supply of money.</li>
<li>Discount rate on banks’ reserve accounts – Determining the cost of banks’ credit, rolled down to their customers</li>
<li>Reserve requirements – Setting the minimum cash reserve ratio of commercial banks</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>CBDCs could be used by central banks as part of the first two conventions, by issuing or absorbing issued CBDCs and by setting the discount rates on CBDC accounts, respectively. Let us further examine the implications of both.</p><h3 id="adjusting-discount-rates"  class='title-h3'
    >Adjusting Discount Rates</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Utilizing CBDCs for Open Market Operations may be highly efficient and even improve central banks’ current arsenal. Naturally, that depends on whether the CBDC is considered a desirable asset by the economic agents, i.e. banks, households (i.e. individuals), companies, government, etc. </p><p  class='text-p'>A simplified scenario assumes that households are able to manage CBDC accounts in the central bank, and consider it as an adequate substitute for cash and retail bank accounts. As they increasingly use them, the central bank’s liability shifts from banknotes towards CBDCs, thus reducing commercial banks’ cash reserves and pushing them to increase their CBDC reserves. The outcome of this scenario is an increase in the central bank’s CBDC liability and CBDC credit facilities, while its banknote liability decreases. </p><p  class='text-p'>In the eyes of the central bank, it will be required to hold assets to back up its CBDC liabilities in the same manner it would have needed to back banknotes. In short, CBDCs could be implemented as part of a central bank’s OMO strategy just like printing cash. However, as it is easier to issue a digital currency than printing new cash, the process is more efficient for the central bank. </p><p  class='text-p'>Let us now examine how CBDCs can be used to set market discount rates. This becomes more straightforward once CBDC accounts are available for everyone – not just commercial banks. Moreover, once the counterparty risk is eliminated and everyone has direct access to the central bank, CBDCs are likely to become the most secure and liquid asset in the market. The mechanism of this interest rate would be similar to that of the discount rate on banks’ reserves today. </p><p  class='text-p'>As mentioned above, the central bank may set CBDC interest rates as positive, negative or zero. Each policy would result in different outcomes depending on the central bank’s intention. While a positive rate might establish the market’s inflation rate or even an indicated risk-free interest rate, a zero-percent interest rate may support the notion that CBDC is electronic cash. The case for negative interest rate is more tricky as it might create two sets of currencies, i.e. a currency denoted by cash in circulation and another one denoted by the CBDC reserve accounts . On the face of it, this might cause instability, but might be useful in other scenarios when extreme measures are required.</p><h3 id="reducing-amount-of-circulated-cash"  class='title-h3'
    >Reducing amount of circulated cash</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Another potential merit of CBDCs is reducing the amount of circulated cash in the market. In our opinion, a modern economy should aspire to be as efficient as possible. One way to reach this goal is to minimize, if not outright eliminate, the use of physical cash. One may argue that people could never overcome the  psychological need for “physical” money. Still, the history of currency challenges that presupposition. Before notes, coins were the primary form of payment, backed by the metal’s intrinsic value. However, as soon as people realized that carrying a single note that guarantees 100 coins is more convenient than carrying 100 heavy coins, notes gained popularity. The leap of faith was on the receiving side, acknowledging that notes had no intrinsic value and were bonded to some reserve that backed its declared value. Therefore, they had to be confident that there actually is a third party who guaranteed the note’s written value, if required. For many years, countries backed the money they issued with gold reserves and other valuable metals, or issued money back in the foreign currencies of other countries who did so. Only in 1971, as part of the Nixon Shock, the United States abolished direct convertibility of USD to gold. By doing this, it finally became evident that currency note value was only backed conceptually, not physically. </p><p  class='text-p'>Needless to mention that there are multiple substitutes for cash – credit cards or other digital payment services for example – although not necessarily perfect substitutes, either because of a credit fee or on account of partial adoption. While the former is on account of a competitive market, the latter may be influenced by government policy. Therefore, if a government decides to abolish the use of cash, e-wallet adoption would likely increase immediately. </p><p  class='text-p'>Naturally, any migration to a cashless economy should be gradual in order to deploy proper digital infrastructure, anticipate potential security threats, and educate the public for the upcoming change (something that India’s demonetization experiment did not do). It is our view that removing a reliance on cash is in the best interest of most, if not all, countries. Furthermore, our estimation is that the general public would consider CBDC as the closest substitute for cash, hence issuing it could be the first step towards a cashless economy. </p><h3 id="driving-competition-in-banking-industry"  class='title-h3'
    >Driving Competition in Banking Industry</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The banking industry is undergoing a major change. Digitization technologies make core banking services trivial. As a result, banking services broaden the reach to wider audiences, undermining the advantage of deep acquaintance with customers. </p><p  class='text-p'>Core banking services, such as a checking account, are already becoming redundant as consumers have alternatives such as e-wallets. In addition, calls for reform, such as <a href="http://www.narrowbanking.org/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Narrow Banking</a> have been proposed as a better solution for most consumer checking accounts. Narrow Banking suggests that deposit accounts should be separated from all other banking activities, and be kept in dedicated banks, i.e. narrow banks. Those banks will have full reserves against those deposits, and could only lend money of the depositors who agreed not to keep their deposits liquid. Thus, CBDC will provide the public with an additional, central bank-based, alternative. I believe this is the next step in making those trivial banking services into true public utilities. This shift will probably result in transition of checking accounts out of commercial banks.</p><p  class='text-p'>Some, like the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/central-bank-digital-currencies-fuel-bank-runs-bis-says" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Bank of International Settlements</a>, suggest that this might threaten financial stability as banks’ cash reserves decrease, and in certain scenarios might end up in a bank run. We consider this to be an extreme scenario, and believe that central banks have the tools to prevent that, as discussed in the next section. An alternative and far more likely scenario in my view, is that commercial banks will readapt. In order to be competitive, they would likely have to increase the interest rate on deposits to attract these deposits back, which may result in increasing credit spreads. In the short term, banks’ profits might decrease, forcing them to be more efficient. This is due to the excess profit that banks make out of these services. This would be a positive outcome from the general public’s perspective, both in releasing value and in improving the efficiency of the financial system. In the middle and long terms, I expect banks to start generating new revenue streams by providing new financial services, and by focusing on services that produce real value to the consumer.</p><p  class='text-p'>While focusing on the benefits, we do not suggest that deploying CBDCs is a walk in the park. It involves both technical difficulties and political and economical challenges. Those will be further discussed in our next post on this topic.</p></div></div></div><div class="single-blog-bottom"><h3 class="single-blog-bottom-title">Get involved</h3><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex flex-between"><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/logo.svg" alt="orbs logo"/><h4>White papers</h4><a href="../white-papers" target="_blank">Read the Orbs white papers</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/github.svg" alt="github icon"/><h4>GitHub Repo</h4><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network" target="_blank">Review the code &amp; contribute</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/documents.svg" alt="document icon"/><h4>Documentation</h4><a href="../white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians" target="_blank">Developer documentation</a></div></div></div></main><div class="subscribe" style="display:none"><section class="subscribe-overlay"></section><form class="subscribe-form form"><button type="button" class="form-close-btn" aria-label="Close"><img src="../assets/img/common/close.svg" alt="close"/></button><h3 class="form-title">SUBSCRIBE FOR UPDATES</h3><div class="form-content flex-column"><div class="form-success" style="background:#191919"><p  class='text-p'>Amazing!

Simply select ORBS from the token pull down menu and then select the AVAX mainnet as the destination chain.</p><p  class='text-p'>AnySwap can also be used to <a href="https://www.orbs.com/orbs-is-now-live-on-binance-smart-chain-via-anyswap-cross-chain-bridge/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>bridge</a> ORBS tokens onto the BSC network, thereby making it a three-way bridge enabling Orbs token holders to move ORBS between the Ethereum, Avalanche and BSC chains!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/AnySwap-Avalanche/img2.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>You can find the bridged ORBS token contract on AVAX here:</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://avascan.info/blockchain/c/token/0x340fE1D898ECCAad394e2ba0fC1F93d27c7b717A" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://avascan.info/blockchain/c/token/0x340fE1D898ECCAad394e2ba0fC1F93d27c7b717A</a></p><p  class='text-p'>As always, exercise caution when working with 3rd party technologies, educate yourself regarding the risks involved and read all <a href="https://github.com/anyswap/Anyswap-Audit/blob/master/SlowMist/AnySwap%20CrossChain-Bridge%20Security%20Audit%20Report.pdf" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>security audits</a>.</p><h3 id="no-stopping-the-orbs-avalanche"  class='title-h3'
    >No Stopping the Orbs Avalanche</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>As we discussed in our <a href="https://www.orbs.com/Orbs-Coming-to-Avalanche/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>latest</a> blog post, Orbs has targeted Avalanche as its next avenue for expansion, being one of the fastest growing Layer-1 chains with over $3.17B in TVL!</p><p  class='text-p'>The Avalanche ecosystem is exploding, following the launch of an impressive $180M grant program, with over <a href="https://ecosystem.avax.network/marketplace?tag=" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>140 ecosystem partners</a> and more than <a href="https://www.avax-projects.com/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>320 projects</a> building on its blockchain. Some of these include major players like SushiSwap, Chainlink, Circle and the Graph.</p><p  class='text-p'>With this latest integration, Orbs is now live on all 5 major L-1 chains: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Solana, and now - Avalanche. This in turn accelerated the integration of the Orbs ecosystem with over 17 major DeFi protocols (such as UniSwap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, Kyber Networks, 1inch, Alpaca Finance, Beefy Finance, QuickSwap, DinoSwap, with more to come soon...)</p><p  class='text-p'>Orbs unique features designed for interoperability primarily with EVM-compatible blockchains, together with its decentralized network of nodes, gives it a competitive advantage in various DeFi applications.</p><p  class='text-p'>We are very excited about tapping the potential of Orbs in the DeFi space. Orbs multi-chain integration plays a critical role in this initiative. Already we are seeing applications of amazing innovative projects being developed on Orbs.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Expect more to come in the near future!</strong></p><div class='line-separator'></div>

    >Potential Difficulties</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Naturally, deploying CBDCs involves certain difficulties, especially during the transition phase. Therefore, all relevant authorities and government agencies must be attentive and responsive in order to effectively mitigate issues as they present themselves.</p><p  class='text-p'>Among the potential difficulties we foresee, we expect the impact on the banking industry to be the most significant. As briefly described in prior witings, banks to some extent might experience a liquidity challenge affecting their available credit reserves, thus making credit more expensive through higher interest rates. There could be several paths to alleviate this and increase cash reserves:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Generating new lines of business - The banking industry could undergo a major shakeup as new blockchain-based platforms are deployed, and many traditional (and highly profitable) services will no longer be provided by banks. It will challenge banks to redefine their role in the new economy and to adapt accordingly. While some banks probably see this as a threat, others could use this as an opportunity to grab substantial market share as the demand for new financial services grows. From the general public&#39;s perspective and even the central bank&#39;s, this spur in competition is positive, forcing banks to become more efficient overall.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Central banks are in control of the deposit discount rate, and are therefore in control of the demand for CBDC and for banks&#39; cash reserves. Therefore, the likeliest scenario is one where the central bank will set an interest rate (on CBDC reserves) to reach a new, improved and stable equilibrium. That equilibrium will see only a limited portion of banks&#39; cash reserves flow to CBDC deposits, not most of it and certainly not all of it. As with other similar kinds of economic stabilization measures, it may take some time for the market to readjust, but the market will reach a new and better state, given that the central bank is trusted by the commercial banks</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The role of central banks is to balance several responsibilities in order to maintain a reliable, growing financial market. Providing the option of opening a CBDC account with the central bank makes any person or entity a de facto customer of the central bank. No one actually intends to have them deal directly with the general public, rather they would essentially outsource this service to commercial banks, generating a new line of business and new stream of revenues</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The new CBDC deposit accounts will not be credit facilities. Those will only be provided by commercial banks. Thus banks will focus on offering their customers active financial services rather than just money storage</p></li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>There may be additional difficulties involved in the process of migrating to CBDC, however we will only discuss two more: user privacy and raising sufficient public awareness.</p><p  class='text-p'>Firstly, privacy and anonymity, especially in the context of payment services, will always be a point of contention. On the one hand, many want full domain over their privacy by having the option to use fully anonymous means of payment. On the other hand, such features might be exploited by nefarious actors for illegal activity and tax evasion. As previously noted, CBDCs may provide different levels of user privacy, depending on the central bank&#39;s policy. The most simple solution would be leaving only the lowest value banknotes available, while limiting the allowed value per cash transaction. That would make the transition towards a true cashless economy smoother and quicker. In certain countries, it may even allow policy makers a defense against critics, as not all cash has been abolished.</p><p  class='text-p'>Secondly, getting the public on board may present difficulties. Public awareness campaigns and proper education should mitigate this. We truly believe that any argument that certain parts of the population could not handle this transition and might be victims for potential fraud are patently absurd. Yes, there will be fraudsters and it will take longer for some to &quot;master&quot; the use of digital payments. However, this genuine concern is not reason enough to reject change outright. Had that been the case, there would have been no move to e-banking, internet or mobile devices. Can you imagine our world today without any of them?</p><h3 id="suggested-strategic-outline"  class='title-h3'
    >Suggested Strategic Outline</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In light of the above, and assuming that we have been able to persuade the reader that CBDCs are a powerful instrument that ought to be adopted by central banks, we suggest the following strategy, which calls for a centralized CBDC on a private blockchain protocol but which allows for development into a decentralized protocol - if the technology proves itself to be viable. Deployment would occur in three steps according to this strategy, spread over several years, but starting sooner rather than later. There is no point in indicating the length of each phase, which would be an open question, but we certainly expect a central bank to set reasonable targets on this roadmap and stick to that plan.</p><ol>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 1 - Introducing CBDC Light, for digital payments only. This currency is the light version of the later full-featured centralized CBDC. The general public may open reserve accounts at the central bank, but they will not carry interest and are intended to be used as the central bank&#39;s certified digital wallets. The goal is to introduce the advantages of using digital payment services and reduce the use of cash to a minimum, leaving only the lowest value bills in circulation. This period will allow commercial banks to start getting used to the idea of having a CBDC, knowing that a full-featured CBDC is waiting just around the corner.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 2 - Introducing a full-featured centralized CBDC. Once the public and commercial banks are accustomed to this lighter CBDC, the central bank upgrades it to a full-featured implementation in order to maximize its merits and utilize it as a full monetary instrument. This period involves potential disruptions to the economy, as discussed above. It is up to the central bank to manage the process carefully in order to drive the economy towards its new equilibrium, in which commercial banks are more efficient and generate new revenue streams. In parallel, the central bank during this time closely examines blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets in order to determine when it would be suitable to deploy a decentralized CBDC</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 3 - Discussing decentralization. As noted earlier, we are still not convinced that CBDC decentralization is necessary or ever will be. Still, we urge central banks to think about it, even if just to push the envelope as a thought-experiment, so that as technology advances, they will be in a position to decide if implementation is the correct strategy for them. We are certain that with time, new technology would provide better solutions to problems that we now cannot see being resolved. Central banks should focus their efforts on understanding several key topics which are critical to a decentralized protocol:</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What is the desired level of user privacy and anonymity?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Who are the participating nodes?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>How does the White chain operate?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What are the KYC &amp; AML procedures for opening an account on that chain?</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion"  class='title-h3'
    >Conclusion</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In this series of posts, we have provided a brief overview of CBDCs and why they should be implemented sooner rather than later. Since CBDCs are such a powerful instrument, their implementation must be calculated and methodical in order to maximize their merits and minimize their demerits.</p><p  class='text-p'>The roles and importance of major actors in our global economy are constantly questioned as we head towards a &#39;new economy&#39;. Each and every one of them will have to adapt to technological innovation in order to maintain relevance and in their position of maintaining market stability. The same goes for central banks. Being the economy&#39;s equivalent of the &quot;responsible adults&quot; in the room, they must engage.</p><p  class='text-p'>We support the recent trend of central banks experimenting and considering issuing a CBDC. In our view, central banks that are looking to lead rather than be led, cannot ignore the potential benefits of this opportunity nor the pitfalls of failing to follow what seems like an inevitable culmination of digital economic innovation over the last two decades.</p></div></div></div></ul></div><div class="footer-tweets"><section class="footer-section-title"><img
