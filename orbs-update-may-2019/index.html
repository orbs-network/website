On one hand, we were all in a bit of euphoria after the successful launch of our production layer, while at the same time productivity really kicked into overdrive. In this post, I want to involve our followers with happenings at Orbs on all fronts from events to tech. First things first:</p><h2 id="-strong-the-big-korea-launch-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    ><strong>THE BIG Korea Launch</strong></h2>
<p  class='text-p'>After a year of activity in Korea, Orbs team has hit some important and impressive milestones of brand awareness, a strong community, and engagement with major enterprises:</p><h3 id="-strong-enterprise-event-with-the-israeli-economic-mission-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>Enterprise Event with the Israeli Economic Mission</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The event on April 3rd targeted Korean enterprises in several industries: More than 30 corporate representatives attended the private event to hear Orbs Co-founder Uriel Peled&#39;s talk. Following the event, Orbs team has held a number of 1:1 meetings with those who’ve requested it, including:</p><ul>
<li>Enterprise telcos</li>
<li>Automotive companies</li>
<li>Prominent blockchain companies</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-strong-deconomy-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>Deconomy</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>April 4th: Orbs’ booth and VIP room were incredibly busy, and Uriel Peled’s keynote speech was very well received. Check out the slides from the event here:</p><iframe src='https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSSWf97wTyUbjPFGRYgDE9Y-wZTwrQlpmqEAWLJoYXOD1im3LJDtr8YYci-_28A8iSyBlFn0MQ73EMl/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000'></iframe>

<p  class='text-p'>Orbs team has been exploring use-cases and tech with key members of the industry. Gili has a lot of follow-ups to take care of! Some of the highlights from the Korea meetup: [embedyt] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2htLz\_st78\[/embedyt\]" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2htLz\_st78\[/embedyt\]</a></p><p  class='text-p'>Later, Uriel gave an excellent interview to TokenPost, the full version of which you can watch below: [embedyt]<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxJ-sL0AtZY\[/embedyt\]" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxJ-sL0AtZY\[/embedyt\]</a> Our Korean readers may want to check out the <a href="https://www.tokenpost.kr/article-8071" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>full TokenPost article</a>. Overall, this was arguably our greatest Korean event, with enormous lines and lots of fruitful meetings. Thank you, everyone, and especially our AMAZING Korean community and team!</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><h2 id="-strong-other-events-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    ><strong>Other events</strong></h2>
<h3 id="-strong-orbs-launch-tel-aviv-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>ORBS Launch Tel Aviv</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>After months of meeting and working with everyone in the universe, we finally needed some “us” time. So, a week after the launch of our network, we held a private party here at our HQ office in Tel Aviv on April 3rd. Speeches, toasts, food drinks and dancing with family and friends were just what the doctor ordered for us to come back to work at full blast.</p><h3 id="-strong-noah-conference-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>NOAH Conference</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The European NOAH conference came to Tel Aviv, and Orbs was a key speaker in the field of enterprise blockchain technology. The event hosted 2,000 technology CEOs, executives and investors seeking to establish new business relationships and gain early insights into the latest proven tech concepts. Orbs was represented on the big stage by our technological Co-founder Tal Kol, who presented a crystal-clear vision of blockchain&#39;s competitive, open-source future. The short 10-minute speech can be viewed in the embedded video below. If you’re a latecomer and want to understand the full scope of what we are working on, without too much technical jargon -- THIS is the speech to listen to: [embedyt] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4btt3F4o70\[/embedyt\]" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4btt3F4o70\[/embedyt\]</a></p><h3 id="-strong-dealmakers-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>Dealmakers</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In <a href="https://www.orbs.com/april-update/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>last month’s update</a>, I&#39;ve mentioned Orbs being a featured partner at the Israel Dealmakers Summit in San Francisco. For those who are wondering what it was like presenting to representatives from the likes of Nasdaq, Microsoft and other high-caliber industry leaders, you can now watch Orbs Head of Partnerships <a href="https://twitter.com/Dannyhbrown" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Danny Brown Wolf</a> predict the future of enterprise blockchain in the video released last week: [embedyt] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diuVDVBhVq8\[/embedyt\]" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diuVDVBhVq8\[/embedyt\]</a></p><p  class='text-p'>We also took part in a panel discussing trends in fintech and held a great conversation about the role of blockchain in the future of the financial world. In addition to Gili Ovadia, Orbs also hosted the following panelists:</p><ul>
<li>Oshri Kaplan, Investment Director – Munich Re Ventures</li>
<li>Ittai Ben-Zeev, Chief Executive Officer – Tel Aviv Stock Exchange</li>
<li>Moderator: Eric Sugar, General Partner and Chief Revenue Officer – Landmark Ventures</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><h2 id="-strong-orbs-community-on-discourse-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    ><strong>Orbs Community on Discourse</strong></h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Ladies and gents, we have <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-community/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>officially opened the Orbs community discussion board</a>! There has been a lot of internal conversations about the best way to enable project related dialogue to the general public. It is important to us that everyone feels welcome to contribute to this community-driven mission and thank all those participating in the board right now. Ultimately, we found that the open-source Discourse platform was the best way to go about it. Come say hello at <a href="https://community.orbs.network/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><strong>community.orbs.network</strong></a> (and don’t forget to bookmark☆).</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><h2 id="-strong-in-case-you-ve-missed-it-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'

<p  class='text-p'>As fans and regular readers of Hackernoon, we were delighted to discover that the highly influential dev magazine chose to publish Tal Kol’s piece, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/blockchain-as-the-next-evolutionary-step-of-the-open-source-movement-12ea8d876578" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>Blockchain as the Next Evolutionary Step of the Open Source Movement</em></a>, on its front page! <figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/orbs-update-may-2019/image3.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>At the end of the month, Tal <a href="https://twitter.com/orbs_network/status/1123249385754722309" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>was featured AGAIN</a> on the front page of Hackernoon with another article, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-blockchain-dichotomy-and-an-architecture-to-overcome-it-d2f75582bab4" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>The Blockchain Dichotomy and an Architecture to Overcome It</em></a>.

    ><strong>Open Source Initiative has an eye on Orbs</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>If that wasn’t neat enough, the Hackernoon post was then retweeted by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) to its some 35k followers. We are die-hard fans of the work done by OSI, so needless to say that getting noticed by this wonderful organization is very flattering.</p><p  class='text-p'>The motivation is clear. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/opensource?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"title="link" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#opensource</a> is good for humanity.

As a global non-profit, the OSI champions software freedom in society through education, collaboration, and infrastructure, stewarding the Open Source Definition (OSD), and preventing abuse of the ideals and ethos inherent to the open source movement.</em> Considering that Orbs has gone fully open-source only a month ago, having already garnered the attention of a firebrand organization like OSI is something everyone here is extremely proud of. We are excited about the possibility of collaborating with a corporation like this, whose work has been a major inspiration to the Orbs project.</p><h3 id="-strong-codc-blockchain-trade-mission-to-israel-strong-"  class='title-h3'

<p  class='text-p'>Orbs has been singled out by The Chamber of Digital Commerce and the U.S. Department of Commerce Commercial Service as an example of what blockchain innovation in Israel is all about!

<p  class='text-p'>This month is Tal’s month, apparently! The daily Hebrew business newspaper TheMarker (by Haaretz) interviewed our Co-founder for a monthly special publication on all things blockchain. Israel has been at the forefront of blockchain development for a couple of years now, so being chosen by one of its leading magazines to represent the booming industry is no small feat.

    ><strong>Other expansion highlights</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'><em>This segment was contributed by Assaf Bielski</em></p><p  class='text-p'>Orbs has been exploring use cases with an industry consortium within the global telecom space, with the aim of developing a shared future blockchain infrastructure onto which multiple blockchain applications would be deployed. Their primary challenge, right now, is guaranteeing trust in the platform even when the consortium grows to hundreds and even thousands of members, not all of whom partake as nodes in the system. Orbs can solve this challenge through its hybrid consensus model, which offers a new trust model for consortia by separating block production from validation offering entirely.</p><p  class='text-p'>Whenever we see opportunities where Orbs is a great fit, it’s important to educate and familiarize these businesses with the project in hopes of them becoming active members of the ecosystem. There’s also lots of work being done on a detailed proposition for a digital identity solution architected on top of Orbs, an area blockchain is widely expected to revolutionize. For the first time, people will be able to control their identity which can be verified through a decentralized network, without any organization holding their data.</p><p  class='text-p'>A major global consumer electronics manufacturer and several IT companies are involved in defining the requirements for such a solution on top of Orbs, and closing in on the first markets to test it. Most production blockchain identity solutions used by enterprises today rely on private blockchains. We see significant value in introducing a public blockchain solution, which addresses additional problems like identity theft.</p><p  class='text-p'>Along with those long-term projects in the community, it’s important to identify “quick wins”; areas in which public blockchain can be used by businesses today, so the project can start engaging with the market and showcase the value of blockchain. One such area of interest is “document notarization” - a simple way for companies to register documents on the blockchain so that their authenticity can be verified at any time. This SDK  is currently in the definition phase. The exciting part about it is how easy it will be to integrate: Most blockchain integration projects for enterprises require a dedicated systems integrator, and are usually both costly ($100K plus) and lengthy (months). This SDK, however, can drop this cost to nil and the time to just several days.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>We are preparing for Consensus 2019</strong>, where Orbs team members will attend and meet companies from different industries to discuss the Orbs project, as well as an educational roadshow in India during which we are scheduled to meet blockchain experts from global technology service providers to discuss potential partnerships within the Orbs ecosystem.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><h2 id="tech-highlights"  class='title-h2 sub-title'

    >Potential Difficulties</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Naturally, deploying CBDCs involves certain difficulties, especially during the transition phase. Therefore, all relevant authorities and government agencies must be attentive and responsive in order to effectively mitigate issues as they present themselves.</p><p  class='text-p'>Among the potential difficulties we foresee, we expect the impact on the banking industry to be the most significant. As briefly described in prior witings, banks to some extent might experience a liquidity challenge affecting their available credit reserves, thus making credit more expensive through higher interest rates. There could be several paths to alleviate this and increase cash reserves:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Generating new lines of business - The banking industry could undergo a major shakeup as new blockchain-based platforms are deployed, and many traditional (and highly profitable) services will no longer be provided by banks. It will challenge banks to redefine their role in the new economy and to adapt accordingly. While some banks probably see this as a threat, others could use this as an opportunity to grab substantial market share as the demand for new financial services grows. From the general public&#39;s perspective and even the central bank&#39;s, this spur in competition is positive, forcing banks to become more efficient overall.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Central banks are in control of the deposit discount rate, and are therefore in control of the demand for CBDC and for banks&#39; cash reserves. Therefore, the likeliest scenario is one where the central bank will set an interest rate (on CBDC reserves) to reach a new, improved and stable equilibrium. That equilibrium will see only a limited portion of banks&#39; cash reserves flow to CBDC deposits, not most of it and certainly not all of it. As with other similar kinds of economic stabilization measures, it may take some time for the market to readjust, but the market will reach a new and better state, given that the central bank is trusted by the commercial banks</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The role of central banks is to balance several responsibilities in order to maintain a reliable, growing financial market. Providing the option of opening a CBDC account with the central bank makes any person or entity a de facto customer of the central bank. No one actually intends to have them deal directly with the general public, rather they would essentially outsource this service to commercial banks, generating a new line of business and new stream of revenues</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The new CBDC deposit accounts will not be credit facilities. Those will only be provided by commercial banks. Thus banks will focus on offering their customers active financial services rather than just money storage</p></li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>There may be additional difficulties involved in the process of migrating to CBDC, however we will only discuss two more: user privacy and raising sufficient public awareness.</p><p  class='text-p'>Firstly, privacy and anonymity, especially in the context of payment services, will always be a point of contention. On the one hand, many want full domain over their privacy by having the option to use fully anonymous means of payment. On the other hand, such features might be exploited by nefarious actors for illegal activity and tax evasion. As previously noted, CBDCs may provide different levels of user privacy, depending on the central bank&#39;s policy. The most simple solution would be leaving only the lowest value banknotes available, while limiting the allowed value per cash transaction. That would make the transition towards a true cashless economy smoother and quicker. In certain countries, it may even allow policy makers a defense against critics, as not all cash has been abolished.</p><p  class='text-p'>Secondly, getting the public on board may present difficulties. Public awareness campaigns and proper education should mitigate this. We truly believe that any argument that certain parts of the population could not handle this transition and might be victims for potential fraud are patently absurd. Yes, there will be fraudsters and it will take longer for some to &quot;master&quot; the use of digital payments. However, this genuine concern is not reason enough to reject change outright. Had that been the case, there would have been no move to e-banking, internet or mobile devices. Can you imagine our world today without any of them?</p><h3 id="suggested-strategic-outline"  class='title-h3'
    >Suggested Strategic Outline</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In light of the above, and assuming that we have been able to persuade the reader that CBDCs are a powerful instrument that ought to be adopted by central banks, we suggest the following strategy, which calls for a centralized CBDC on a private blockchain protocol but which allows for development into a decentralized protocol - if the technology proves itself to be viable. Deployment would occur in three steps according to this strategy, spread over several years, but starting sooner rather than later. There is no point in indicating the length of each phase, which would be an open question, but we certainly expect a central bank to set reasonable targets on this roadmap and stick to that plan.</p><ol>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 1 - Introducing CBDC Light, for digital payments only. This currency is the light version of the later full-featured centralized CBDC. The general public may open reserve accounts at the central bank, but they will not carry interest and are intended to be used as the central bank&#39;s certified digital wallets. The goal is to introduce the advantages of using digital payment services and reduce the use of cash to a minimum, leaving only the lowest value bills in circulation. This period will allow commercial banks to start getting used to the idea of having a CBDC, knowing that a full-featured CBDC is waiting just around the corner.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 2 - Introducing a full-featured centralized CBDC. Once the public and commercial banks are accustomed to this lighter CBDC, the central bank upgrades it to a full-featured implementation in order to maximize its merits and utilize it as a full monetary instrument. This period involves potential disruptions to the economy, as discussed above. It is up to the central bank to manage the process carefully in order to drive the economy towards its new equilibrium, in which commercial banks are more efficient and generate new revenue streams. In parallel, the central bank during this time closely examines blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets in order to determine when it would be suitable to deploy a decentralized CBDC</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 3 - Discussing decentralization. As noted earlier, we are still not convinced that CBDC decentralization is necessary or ever will be. Still, we urge central banks to think about it, even if just to push the envelope as a thought-experiment, so that as technology advances, they will be in a position to decide if implementation is the correct strategy for them. We are certain that with time, new technology would provide better solutions to problems that we now cannot see being resolved. Central banks should focus their efforts on understanding several key topics which are critical to a decentralized protocol:</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What is the desired level of user privacy and anonymity?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Who are the participating nodes?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>How does the White chain operate?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What are the KYC &amp; AML procedures for opening an account on that chain?</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion"  class='title-h3'
    >Conclusion</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In this series of posts, we have provided a brief overview of CBDCs and why they should be implemented sooner rather than later. Since CBDCs are such a powerful instrument, their implementation must be calculated and methodical in order to maximize their merits and minimize their demerits.</p><p  class='text-p'>The roles and importance of major actors in our global economy are constantly questioned as we head towards a &#39;new economy&#39;. Each and every one of them will have to adapt to technological innovation in order to maintain relevance and in their position of maintaining market stability. The same goes for central banks. Being the economy&#39;s equivalent of the &quot;responsible adults&quot; in the room, they must engage.</p><p  class='text-p'>We support the recent trend of central banks experimenting and considering issuing a CBDC. In our view, central banks that are looking to lead rather than be led, cannot ignore the potential benefits of this opportunity nor the pitfalls of failing to follow what seems like an inevitable culmination of digital economic innovation over the last two decades.</p></div></div></div></ul></div><div class="footer-tweets"><section class="footer-section-title"><img
