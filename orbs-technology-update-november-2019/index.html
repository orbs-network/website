<p  class='text-p'><em>There were many changes,  and improvements happening since <a href="https://www.orbs.com/orbs-tech-update-september-2019/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>the last tech update</a>, so once again, we are happy to give you an overview of some of the things we achieved during this time.</em></p><p  class='text-p'><em>One significant related effort is the creation of Marvin, a new stress testing and endurance testing suite that will alert and help identify cases where code changes lead to performance degradations.</em></p><p  class='text-p'><em>An important aspect of the network is its liveness, and we&#39;ve added an internal metric of the liveness of validators. The metric, very basically, checks how many times a validator failed to close a block. Such failure can be because he was malicious or simply because he experienced a brief network outage. If the number of consecutive failures increases, it will hurt the node&#39;s &quot;reputation. This value can help guardians to make an informed decision about voting out nodes that impair the liveness of the entire network. Speaking of reputation, read below about the new status page, that shows the status of live validators.</em></p><p  class='text-p'><em>In case you didn&#39;t notice, the Orbs team released and the validators accepted version 1.2.2 of Orbs network in October, featuring time-based elections, triggers, and the reputation mechanism just mentioned.</em></p><p  class='text-p'><em>You may have noticed in the past company updates, our continued efforts in driving real-world usage to our platform. Below you&#39;ll read about many developments related to the user side of the system, a new demo page that includes links to several demos you can quickly and easily try yourself, and many more.</em></p><p  class='text-p'><em>Another important effort that was made by the research team is to finalize the new staking scheme and enable the utilization of a Management Chain functionality. You can read below the details as well as some of the design decisions that were made during their development.</em></p><p  class='text-p'><em>Finally, two new developers started contributing to our code, and below you&#39;ll be able to read more details about their contributions so far, as well as the details of the things highlighted above and many, many more updates.</em></p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><h2 id="-strong-blockchain-core-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'

</ul>
</li>
<li>After a Gamma version with a broken Golang contract compiler has been released by mistake, added a test that attempts to deploy a contract against a Gamma server running in Docker <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1342" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1342</a></li>
<li>Refactored the Golang contract processor to allow instantiating it with a different set of pre-built contracts than what’s used in production <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1359" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1359</a></li>
<li>Removed the Ethereum simulator usage from our codebase; previously, component tests in the Ethereum cross-chain connector package were being run against go-ethereum’s <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/accounts/abi/bind/backends/simulated.go" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>SimulatedBackend</a>. This caused problems, as it was not intended to actually simulate a full-blow Ethereum network, but rather to just allow running contracts against en EVM. Specifically, the Orbs network uses complicated logic to fetch a “final enough” block number in Ethereum for a transaction that’s currently being executed, so that a transaction will not run a possible block that doesn’t end up in the longest Ethereum chain. This logic is dependent on block number, a concept that’s not supported in SimulatedBackend. As a solution, the Orbs network now runs all of its tests against <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Ganache</a>. <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1369" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1369</a></li>
<li>While investigating a port collision in the in-process E2E test, we found out that if an Orbs node is started with a Gossip port that’s already in use, it will endlessly attempt - and fail - to listen to that port. This PR (<a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1401" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1401</a>) changes this behavior, so now the node will panic and exit in this case.</li>
<li>A common reason for flakiness was that the Gossip TCP server opens a goroutine for each incoming connection, and these goroutines were not being supervised. This resulted in logs being written after tests have been completed, which is not allowed in Golang tests. <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1412" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1412</a></li>

Marvin identifies performance degradation or increases in errors when merging PRs into the master branch. This prevents regression in production code. It does so by running stress and endurance tests against a test network and comparing present and past results.</p><p  class='text-p'>Summarized test results are sent to the developer, along with comparison to existing master branch. In addition, full test results are accessible via Grafana dashboard or directly in the Prometheus TSDB (Time Series database). Prometheus continuously collects metrics from the main test network that runs the master branch. In phase II it will gain the ability to run on every push to an open PR for more immediate developer feedback, and will be able to test the effect of pushing PRs to master prior to actually doing so, preventing unwanted merges. It will also collect logs into an ELK stack for deeper analysis.</p><p  class='text-p'>An initial version of the client that exercises the test network is already written in Go, and the two additional Node.js processes are underway. These are (1) the Orchestrator that listens to external requests (such as from CircleCI) and spawns JobExecutor instances per test job, and (2) the JobExecutor that runs multiple instances of the Go clients. The full code is available on the <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/marvin" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Marvin repo</a>.</p><p  class='text-p'>Running stress tests against testnet yields a notification to Slack, such as this one:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/orbs-technology-update-november-2019/image2.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'><em>(Disclaimer: This is still in development, the results will be more detailed, will compare against previous runs, and will be aggregated from more transactions over a longer time period.)</em></p><p  class='text-p'>Here is Grafana sample output (not related to the Slack message above):</p><p  class='text-p'><strong><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/orbs-technology-update-november-2019/image1.png" alt=""></figure></strong></p><p  class='text-p'><em><a href="https://github.com/noambergIL" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>@noambergIL</a></em></p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Reputation &amp; Committee Generation</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>This new feature allows every Orbs-node to save information about the behavior of the validators. The node keeps track of how many times in a row a validator failed to close a block. When a validator doesn&#39;t close a block, we will make it less likely for it to be the leader of the block committee - this helps the liveliness of the network. Soon this information would be present to the guardians, so they may choose to vote against misbehaving validators.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1299" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1299</a></p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1297" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1297</a></p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1296" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1296</a></p><h3 id="new-types"  class='title-h3'

<p  class='text-p'>Orbs-nodes can support four new types of arguments in public methods of the contract (methods that can be called from the client directly): bool, *big.Int, [20]byte &amp; [32]byte.

<h3 id="orbs-staking-contract"  class='title-h3'
    >Orbs Staking Contract</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The R&amp;D activities on Orbs PoS architecture were focused on the Orbs staking contract.</p><p  class='text-p'>The staking contract development was completed and is now undergoing an external security audit. The contract is available for review in the <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-staking-contract" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>orbs-staking-contract GitHub repo</a> along with a <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-staking-contract/blob/master/docs/CONTRACT.md" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>high-level specification</a>.</p><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs network staking contract is set to be deployed on Ethereum similarly to the ORBS native token. The use of an ERC20 token and a staking contract on the Ethereum blockchain enables the Orbs PoS hybrid model. In the Orbs PoS model, the staking, delegation and validators selection process are done on Ethereum and the Orbs network calculates the election results along with the earned rewards based on the data logged on Ethereum.</p><p  class='text-p'>The staking contract enables Orbs token holders to stake tokens, request to unstake them, entering a cooldown period and withdraw tokens back to their ORBS ERC20 account.</p><p  class='text-p'>An interesting aspect of the Orbs staking contract is the migration strategy. First and foremost, the contract is designed to be immutable such that stakers’ funds are secured and one can not move staked tokens or modify the staking properties without the staker approval. On the other hand, we want to allow stakers to transition to new staking contracts in the future without requiring them to first unstake before staking in a new contract, leaving them without staked tokens for the cooldown period. The proposed staking contract addresses the issue by allowing stakers to explicitly request to migrate their stake to a new staking contract thus allowing a seamless transition.</p><p  class='text-p'>A complementary product for the staking contract is a staking wallet to enable a simpler interface for staking. A staking wallet allows ORBS token holders to interact with the contract without a need to manually construct the transactions. We’ve designed a product definition for such a staking wallet and are starting to develop it. The staking wallet we’re working on may be used by the Orbs community as a reference implementation for additional wallet implementations..</p><h3 id="new-features"  class='title-h3'
    >New Features</h3>
<p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/gadcl" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Gad</a> has completed the specs of two new features: the Management Chain and the Ethereum Proxy.</p><p  class='text-p'>In addition to the benefits coming from the introduction of the Management Chain (see more in the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/orbs-tech-update-september-2019/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>previous tech update</a>), its inclusion obliges supplementing the Orbs network’s infrastructure with cross-Virtual Chain (VC) communication. Communication between different VCs will be regularly used between any VC and the Management Chain but can be employed for other uses such as the design pattern of hierarchical VCs. The management chain will hold every VC’s configuration, for example, the current VC’s validators set. This, in turn, will facilitate coordination between validators assigned to operate a new VC. However, it also implies that the VC is no longer standalone. To audit a VC (and verify its state transitions), one must consume the VC’s configuration from the management chain.</p><p  class='text-p'>The Ethereum Proxy feature will significantly facilitate the process of obtaining and calculating the Election results from Ethereum. Among its benefits is the removal of the external agent that mirrors the Ethereum data and relaxation of demands from an Ethereum node. Now, an Ethereum node needs only to support state queries for the latest 100 blocks rather than 5000 blocks as it formerly used to be.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'>Everything we develop is, as always, updated in our GitHub repositories. Here, we try to point to the things that are actually done and ready to be used, rather than discuss ongoing developments and future plans.</p><p  class='text-p'>Just like in previous updates, and as part of being true to our goal to develop enterprise-class software, we continuously labor to improve ORBS&#39; stability.

    >Potential Difficulties</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Naturally, deploying CBDCs involves certain difficulties, especially during the transition phase. Therefore, all relevant authorities and government agencies must be attentive and responsive in order to effectively mitigate issues as they present themselves.</p><p  class='text-p'>Among the potential difficulties we foresee, we expect the impact on the banking industry to be the most significant. As briefly described in prior witings, banks to some extent might experience a liquidity challenge affecting their available credit reserves, thus making credit more expensive through higher interest rates. There could be several paths to alleviate this and increase cash reserves:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Generating new lines of business - The banking industry could undergo a major shakeup as new blockchain-based platforms are deployed, and many traditional (and highly profitable) services will no longer be provided by banks. It will challenge banks to redefine their role in the new economy and to adapt accordingly. While some banks probably see this as a threat, others could use this as an opportunity to grab substantial market share as the demand for new financial services grows. From the general public&#39;s perspective and even the central bank&#39;s, this spur in competition is positive, forcing banks to become more efficient overall.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Central banks are in control of the deposit discount rate, and are therefore in control of the demand for CBDC and for banks&#39; cash reserves. Therefore, the likeliest scenario is one where the central bank will set an interest rate (on CBDC reserves) to reach a new, improved and stable equilibrium. That equilibrium will see only a limited portion of banks&#39; cash reserves flow to CBDC deposits, not most of it and certainly not all of it. As with other similar kinds of economic stabilization measures, it may take some time for the market to readjust, but the market will reach a new and better state, given that the central bank is trusted by the commercial banks</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The role of central banks is to balance several responsibilities in order to maintain a reliable, growing financial market. Providing the option of opening a CBDC account with the central bank makes any person or entity a de facto customer of the central bank. No one actually intends to have them deal directly with the general public, rather they would essentially outsource this service to commercial banks, generating a new line of business and new stream of revenues</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The new CBDC deposit accounts will not be credit facilities. Those will only be provided by commercial banks. Thus banks will focus on offering their customers active financial services rather than just money storage</p></li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>There may be additional difficulties involved in the process of migrating to CBDC, however we will only discuss two more: user privacy and raising sufficient public awareness.</p><p  class='text-p'>Firstly, privacy and anonymity, especially in the context of payment services, will always be a point of contention. On the one hand, many want full domain over their privacy by having the option to use fully anonymous means of payment. On the other hand, such features might be exploited by nefarious actors for illegal activity and tax evasion. As previously noted, CBDCs may provide different levels of user privacy, depending on the central bank&#39;s policy. The most simple solution would be leaving only the lowest value banknotes available, while limiting the allowed value per cash transaction. That would make the transition towards a true cashless economy smoother and quicker. In certain countries, it may even allow policy makers a defense against critics, as not all cash has been abolished.</p><p  class='text-p'>Secondly, getting the public on board may present difficulties. Public awareness campaigns and proper education should mitigate this. We truly believe that any argument that certain parts of the population could not handle this transition and might be victims for potential fraud are patently absurd. Yes, there will be fraudsters and it will take longer for some to &quot;master&quot; the use of digital payments. However, this genuine concern is not reason enough to reject change outright. Had that been the case, there would have been no move to e-banking, internet or mobile devices. Can you imagine our world today without any of them?</p><h3 id="suggested-strategic-outline"  class='title-h3'
    >Suggested Strategic Outline</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In light of the above, and assuming that we have been able to persuade the reader that CBDCs are a powerful instrument that ought to be adopted by central banks, we suggest the following strategy, which calls for a centralized CBDC on a private blockchain protocol but which allows for development into a decentralized protocol - if the technology proves itself to be viable. Deployment would occur in three steps according to this strategy, spread over several years, but starting sooner rather than later. There is no point in indicating the length of each phase, which would be an open question, but we certainly expect a central bank to set reasonable targets on this roadmap and stick to that plan.</p><ol>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 1 - Introducing CBDC Light, for digital payments only. This currency is the light version of the later full-featured centralized CBDC. The general public may open reserve accounts at the central bank, but they will not carry interest and are intended to be used as the central bank&#39;s certified digital wallets. The goal is to introduce the advantages of using digital payment services and reduce the use of cash to a minimum, leaving only the lowest value bills in circulation. This period will allow commercial banks to start getting used to the idea of having a CBDC, knowing that a full-featured CBDC is waiting just around the corner.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 2 - Introducing a full-featured centralized CBDC. Once the public and commercial banks are accustomed to this lighter CBDC, the central bank upgrades it to a full-featured implementation in order to maximize its merits and utilize it as a full monetary instrument. This period involves potential disruptions to the economy, as discussed above. It is up to the central bank to manage the process carefully in order to drive the economy towards its new equilibrium, in which commercial banks are more efficient and generate new revenue streams. In parallel, the central bank during this time closely examines blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets in order to determine when it would be suitable to deploy a decentralized CBDC</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 3 - Discussing decentralization. As noted earlier, we are still not convinced that CBDC decentralization is necessary or ever will be. Still, we urge central banks to think about it, even if just to push the envelope as a thought-experiment, so that as technology advances, they will be in a position to decide if implementation is the correct strategy for them. We are certain that with time, new technology would provide better solutions to problems that we now cannot see being resolved. Central banks should focus their efforts on understanding several key topics which are critical to a decentralized protocol:</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What is the desired level of user privacy and anonymity?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Who are the participating nodes?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>How does the White chain operate?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What are the KYC &amp; AML procedures for opening an account on that chain?</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion"  class='title-h3'
    >Conclusion</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In this series of posts, we have provided a brief overview of CBDCs and why they should be implemented sooner rather than later. Since CBDCs are such a powerful instrument, their implementation must be calculated and methodical in order to maximize their merits and minimize their demerits.</p><p  class='text-p'>The roles and importance of major actors in our global economy are constantly questioned as we head towards a &#39;new economy&#39;. Each and every one of them will have to adapt to technological innovation in order to maintain relevance and in their position of maintaining market stability. The same goes for central banks. Being the economy&#39;s equivalent of the &quot;responsible adults&quot; in the room, they must engage.</p><p  class='text-p'>We support the recent trend of central banks experimenting and considering issuing a CBDC. In our view, central banks that are looking to lead rather than be led, cannot ignore the potential benefits of this opportunity nor the pitfalls of failing to follow what seems like an inevitable culmination of digital economic innovation over the last two decades.</p></div></div></div></ul></div><div class="footer-tweets"><section class="footer-section-title"><img
