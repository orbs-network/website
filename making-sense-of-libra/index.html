Like many big moments in technology, the launch of Libra marks a step forward not because of unprecedented innovation, but rather because it takes a lot of advancements made in the field and makes use of them in what may become a mainstream product that touches the lives of billions of people. That said, I must add that the work behind Libra is nothing short of brilliant. Integrating so many state-of-the-art technologies into what seems to be 3 very intricate products, that can shortly be ready for large-scale deployment, is extremely complex. In such complex projects, fundamental errors are easy to make and may fail the entire endeavor. From what Libra published so far, I see a robust framework that appears very capable of succeeding at its very ambitious goals.</p><p  class='text-p'>Libra is actually three things tied together: a technology, which I’ll further refer to as the “Libra Blockchain”, a currency I’d call the “Libra coin”, and a payment wallet service called “Calibra”. These three are developed and launched together, but in fact, the Libra Coin could have been launched on other blockchain platforms, the Libra Blockchain could be used for other purposes than the Libra Coin, and Calibra could have been launched completely separate from the former two. In this post, I’ll try to explain what each of these projects is.</p><p  class='text-p'>This post represents my understanding of products and technologies announced by Facebook, Calibra, and the Libra Association. I may be wrong in some of my analysis or may have missed some details. If readers notice anything I might have missed, please shoot me an email and I’ll happily correct. Some of my analysis is based on speculation or forecast, especially when speculating about the strategy of the involved players. Speculation about strategy should be taken with more than a grain of salt, as not only the speculation could be wrong, but also the strategies tend to change over time.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-libra-coin-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >What is the Libra Coin?</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Of the 3 parts in Libra’s announcement, the coin gets the most buzz and is mostly referred to as the revolutionary part of Libra. In this case, I believe, the rumors of a revolution have been premature.</p><p  class='text-p'>Let’s start with what the Libra Coin is not: it is not a form of digital cash that will replace whatever form of payment people use. In fact, it does not appear to be aimed at “people”, “end users” or “consumers” at all. (That part will be covered by Calibra). This is my conclusion from having read through the Libra whitepapers and noticing what isn’t there:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Libra cannot offer its users privacy</strong>. This is not a small subject or something that can be dealt with later. I find it highly unlikely that consumers will agree to having their payments exposed to anyone, and even less likely that regulators will allow it (in Europe and California, and some other territories, we know for certain this is forbidden). Businesses are even less likely to allow their competitors to see their cash inflow day-by-day, minute-by-minute, transaction-by-transaction.</li>
<li><strong>By itself, Libra isn’t compliant with financial regulation</strong>. Despite the romantic charm in the idea of currencies that cannot be blocked or apprehended by governments, financial regulation has proven to be effective (and relatively nonviolent) means in combating crime and terrorism. Most people trust their governments and would rather have their governments protect them, and nothing in Facebook&#39;s and Libra’s statements makes me suspect <a href="https://twitter.com/davidmarcus/status/1142102182675787776" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>they don’t see things this way</a>. Plus, being a framework for money laundering is just going to get Libra banned from interacting with the fiat financial system, which will add friction for consumers wanting to use it.</li>
<li><strong>Libra floats independently from any other currency</strong>, adding inherent friction to the experience of using it in consumer transactions. Although spending on digital services is on the rise, most people’s earnings are in their local currency and so is most of their spend. Using another coin is unnatural and makes transactions harder for the consumer. The user experience gets even worse if we think about periods of relative fluctuations in the exchange rates between currencies. If Libra was intended for consumers, they could have issued local currencies — libra$, libra€, libra£, libra¥ and so on — and automatically convert one’s local currencies in the (less frequent) cross-border transactions, as credit cards payments do.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>So if Libra isn’t a currency for consumers, what is it really? I believe it is designed to be a means for settlements between large apps and custodian wallets, in such a way that the consumer accounts are managed on private ledgers and only aggregate settlements occur on-chain.</p><p  class='text-p'>For example, let’s imagine two apps using the Libra network - Uber and Calibra. Calibra users may pay Libras for their Uber ride, but they don’t need to send money off their own Libra account on the blockchain to their ride’s Libra address. Instead, the transaction details are agreed between by the operators of both applications (a state channel can be used for this, but in fact, the use of a cryptographic protocol is not necessary). Calibra and Uber will see many payments going through between them in either direction and will periodically settle the balance by sending Libra between the two companies’ accounts on the blockchain.</p><p  class='text-p'>We can see parallels between this use of Libra to the use of the SWIFT network, which is primarily used for low-frequency settlement payments between businesses. Libra Coin can be seen as a parallel to XDR, a basket of currencies that is defined by the World Bank and is sometimes used in cross-border contracts as an interim currency for settlements. For example, telco operators from different countries, which bill each others’ subscribers for call termination and roaming services, use XDR for their settlements thus avoiding a situation where one operator’s local currency is used instead of the other’s.</p><h2 id="what-is-calibra-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >What is Calibra?</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Hopefully, I convinced you that Libra Coin is not intended to be a universal form of payment. But the buzz that we hear — everywhere from morning shows on TV, financial newspapers and all the way to crypto-twitter — says it is. The confusion comes from mixing it with Calibra, which does aim to become a universal payment app.</p><p  class='text-p'>Calibra is a payment wallet that will be integrated into WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, the world’s most popular messaging apps, with a reach of 1.6bn and 1.3bn people respectively (the third runner-up is WeChat, the most popular messaging and payments app in Asia, with around 1bn users). It is similar in nature to other payment/wallet apps like Venmo, Zelle, WeChat and hundreds of other apps operating globally.</p><p  class='text-p'>As such, Calibra <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/544Gxxg/calibra-msb-registration.pdf" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>is licensed in the State of California as a money transmitter</a>, and will probably acquire similar licenses in other territories in which it launches the wallet service. They devoted a large team filled with PayPal veterans (located just a few floors below my office in Tel Aviv) to fraud prevention, which is less common with crypto wallets where payments cannot be revoked. Most likely, transactions between Calibra users will be processed on its internal ledger, and have nothing to do with blockchain. That way Calibra can operate as early as 2020 without worrying about violating privacy laws or financial regulation.</p><p  class='text-p'>One difference remains between Calibra and other wallet apps, and that is the use of local currencies for payments. Product prototypes illustrated on the Calibra website show users converting their local currency to Libra when making transactions. My guess is Calibra will end up using local currencies by default, rather than converting to Libra, except in cross-border payments. If that is the case, the estimates of the size of the Libra Coin economy and the size of the fiat reserves it is expected to stockpile are also exaggerated.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-libra-blockchain-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >What is the Libra Blockchain?</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>In addition to the coin and payments app, Libra introduced a distributed ledger protocol for smart contracts on which the Libra Coin will be issued. While the protocol does not boast any exciting novelties, it does represent a well-designed state-of-the-art DLT.</p><h4 id="governance-and-consensus-structure"  class='title-h4'
    >Governance and Consensus Structure</h4>
<p  class='text-p'>Hopes that the blockchain protocol introduced by Facebook can be permissionless were baseless. When the main stakeholder behind a project is a company with $200bn in market cap and over $10bn in cash reserves, both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake schemes would prove powerless if that stakeholder wishes to assert a point. Unsurprisingly, Libra chose to form a consortium in which every company around the table gets an equal vote.</p><p  class='text-p'>Personally, I think this is a good development. We’ve only had permissionless protocols for a few years and already there are serious doubts on whether they are sustainable. Whereas proof-of-work comes at a huge cost to the environment and wreaks havoc in the energy markets, the economic costs of scaling a proof-of-stake network in an incentive-compliant manner (i.e. no security risks) are still unknown. Even state-of-the-art systems like the one we use in Orbs may take years to validate. Crypto world needs fallback options in case permissionless models prove to be unsustainable, and of these options, consortium and federated models appear to be the most promising ones.</p><h4 id="consensus-protocol-and-system-core"  class='title-h4'
    >Consensus Protocol and System Core</h4>
<p  class='text-p'>LibraBFT is a permissioned, leader-based consensus protocol with finality based on the HotStuff consensus protocol, which is in turn based on PBFT. In the <a href="https://medium.com/orbs-network/its-not-about-pow-pos-the-two-main-families-of-consensus-models-c5fe1c24ef0c" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>great debate of consensus protocols</a>, they chose a fast consensus protocol with finality, over a more secure “eventual-finality” protocol. But in some sense, this already feels like the debate of last year, and the verdict (fast finality) is already given.</p><p  class='text-p'>One design choice that does catch the eye is that the consensus is reached regarding the current state, rather than block content. This may seem confusing to people who aren’t into the architecture of blockchain protocols and even sparked a debate in crypto-twitter about whether Libra can even call itself a “blockchain”.</p><p  class='text-p'>I’ll try to explain what this means: in classical DLTs, every node maintains its view on the state of the ledger. Every new block is signed and distributed, and if it is verified in consensus, every node processes the block and applies the changes to the ledger. Since all nodes process the same block, they should have all reached the same state after processing it.</p><p  class='text-p'>This has practical implications on how the node operates. Nodes are not required by the protocol to maintain transaction history or to regenerate their ledger state by re-executing the transaction history. This saves on both storage, as storing the entire block history with some overhead of cryptographic signatures can add significant costs to maintaining the ledger, and on the simplicity of putting a node up-to-speed with its peers, as recreating the state by replaying millions of transactions tends to be a complicated and unstable process. It also helps prevent a theoretical state (which could occur due to a bug in the software implementation) in which the two data stores, the block storage and the state storage, are inconsistent with each other. In blockchain protocols in which the truth is determined by the blocks, an inconsistency between the two stores could result in a future blockchain fork. Libra’s consensus over the ledger state would, in such a case, stop writing to the ledger until the inconsistency is resolved. While the latter may sound less healthy (stopping the entire system), this is the preferred design choice because it is extremely hard, and sometimes impossible, to remedy an inconsistent ledger following a fork. On the other hand, it makes forking impossible even in the theoretical case consensus was reached over invalid transactions, which raises concerns about validators having the power to corrupt the ledger without remedy.</p><h4 id="smart-contracts"  class='title-h4'
    >Smart Contracts</h4>
<p  class='text-p'>Although the Libra Blockchain is a general-purpose smart contracts platform, it is focused mostly on crypto-asset transfers. Libra are introducing a new language for smart contracts, called Move, with inherent advantages in managing such assets. Features such as formal validation of asset integrity, both in compile time and in runtime, are very promising. In my opinion, this is the most exciting novelty of Libra.</p><p  class='text-p'>Moreover, Move has a great potential in beating Ethereum’s EVM and Solidity in their home field. In my opinion, EVM has failed to become a safe environment for agreeing on and implementing smart contracts. Hopefully, Move can fix much of what is wrong with EVM. However, the main caveat of using bytecode as a basis for smart-contract remains: smart contracts need to be human-readable, and it is unlikely that humans will be able to review and consent to a bytecode contract. The alternative is using the source code as the basis for the agreement (and have every node compile or interpret it independently). This requires consensus to allow for nondeterministic execution, which raises a lot of implementation challenges. On the other hand, it opens the door to using existing programming languages, making smart contract development more approachable.</p><h2 id="still-a-big-deal"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Still a Big Deal</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>The fact that a lot of the hype revolves around misconceptions on how Libra will work, does not make it any less significant. Libra creates a powerful combination of a world-wide, hugely adopted payments app, with a blockchain platform that enables any business to connect to that payment network seamlessly (and with the added benefit of being able to use smart contracts as they do so), and an intermediate currency that facilitates cross-border trade. Its mission, as I see it, is to create an alternative financial infrastructure in which large consumer-facing apps interact that is independent of the current banking system. If this happens, it will have huge implications on the structure of the global financial system, and on the power of governments, banks and institutional investors in it.</p><h4 id="where-it-leaves-us"  class='title-h4'

<p  class='text-p'>With all that in mind, I have to ask myself, where does all that leave Orbs, the public blockchain platform I participate in creating? Perhaps I’m overly optimistic, but the way I see it Libra’s success would be great news for us. Being a general-purpose smart contracts platform, aiming to become the infrastructure of any public decentralized application, we don’t really feel that we’re in competition with Libra on being a specialized infrastructure for financial services. On the other hand, many of the challenges we face are aligned, and both projects have a lot to gain from the R&amp;D efforts of the other. Libra will also face the challenge of bringing a lot of the concepts of decentralized governance and being permissionless to mainstream uses, facing regulators, public opinion, academia and more. On many of these fronts they will be pioneers, and the results of their actions will affect much of the blockchain industry.</p></div></div></div><div class="single-blog-bottom"><h3 class="single-blog-bottom-title">Get involved</h3><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex flex-between"><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/logo.svg" alt="orbs logo"/><h4>White Papers</h4><a href="../white-papers" target="_blank">Read the Orbs white papers</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/github.svg" alt="github icon"/><h4>GitHub Repos</h4><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network" target="_blank">Review the code &amp; contribute</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/documents.svg" alt="document icon"/><h4>Documentation</h4><a href="https://docs.orbs.network" target="_blank">Developer documentation</a></div></div></div></main><div class="gdpr"><p  class='text-p'>We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

Thank you to all developers, contributors, researchers, guardians, delegators, community members, partners, and others who helped make 2022 a successful year. </p><p  class='text-p'>At the start of 2022, we identified <a href="https://www.orbs.com/Orbs3.0/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>key components</a> of Orbs 3.0: These included how Orbs fits into web3, Multi-chain staking (PoS V3), and Orbs as a layer-3 (L3). The below will lay out the project&#39;s progress on each of these pillars since the beginning of 2022 and how they will continue to propel forward the Orbs project in 2023. </p><h3 id="orbs-3-0-amp-web3"  class='title-h3'
    >Orbs 3.0 &amp; Web3</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>At the start of 2022, we sought to define Orbs’ place in web3; this was dubbed Orbs 3.0. Orbs 3.0 is the overarching framework for the project. The components are comprised of multi-chain proof-of-stake (PoS), L3 Orbs, and web3.  </p><p  class='text-p'>With regards to web3,  both at the beginning of the year, and now, Orbs has been based on the <a href="https://defi.org/defi-belief-system/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>philosophy</a> that web3 is the pursuit of creating permissionless applications where users can have a stake in the project, participate in governance votes, own their data, and can monetize their stake. </p><p  class='text-p'>Everything created for the Orbs project in  2022 was aligned with this philosophy and furthers the web3 narrative. </p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/Orbs-in-2022-Driving-Forces-of-Adoption/image1.jpeg" alt="Orbs3"></figure></p><h3 id="pos-v3-multi-chain-staking"  class='title-h3'
    >PoS V3 Multi-chain Staking</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>For those unfamiliar, the Orbs protocol is decentralized and executed by a public network of permissionless validators (dubbed &quot;Guardians&quot;) using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. The Orbs protocol relies on the ORBS token, which provides a system of incentives used to elect Guardians in a secure and decentralized manner.</p><p  class='text-p'>In response to community feedback to mitigate gas spikes, in 2022 we launched <a href="https://www.orbs.com/polygon-staking/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>multi-chain staking</a> on Ethereum and Polygon, dubbed PoS V3. The upgrade allowed the Orbs network to utilize the available blockchain stack to its fullest potential, the security of Ethereum as the base layer, and the scalability &amp; low fees of Polygon as a layer 2.</p><p  class='text-p'>After a year of multi-chain staking being live, there are <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x614389eaae0a6821dc49062d56bda3d9d45fa2ff?a=0xeeae6791f684117b7028b48cb5dd21186df80b9c#tokenAnalytics" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>191 million</a> ORBS staked at the time of writing on Polygon with an additional <a href="https://analytics.orbs.network/ethereum/overview/stake" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>775 million</a> ORBS staked on Ethereum. This past year, the number of Guardians has also grown, with 7 new Guardians helping to secure the network and fostering community growth.</p><h3 id="orbs-as-a-layer-3-blockchain"  class='title-h3'
    >Orbs as a Layer-3 blockchain</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>At the start of the year, we <a href="https://www.orbs.com/How-Orbs-Hybrid-Architecture-Is-Becoming-a-Game-Changer-in-DeFi/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>explained</a> to the community what Orbs as a layer 3 protocol meant and defined the goal of positioning Orbs onto the existing blockchain stack; and to have a fully functioning use case by the end of 2022.  </p><p  class='text-p'>Since then, we’ve developed Orbs’ two main L3 execution services: <a href="https://www.orbs.com/Deep-Dive-to-Orbs-Lambda/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs Lambda</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.orbs.com/Deep-Dive-to-Orbs-VM/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs VM</a>. Orbs Lambda functions as a decentralized serverless cloud and Orbs VM as a Docker-based decentralized virtual machine. This technology has been able to power L3 DeFi applications such as The Open DeFi Notification Protocol &amp; dTWAP.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://defi.org/notifications/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>DeFi notifications</a> is the first in-house use case developed for L3 Orbs. Since its inception at the beginning of the year, it has been integrated with 30+ dApps, and successfully audited over 200,000 on-chain transactions, with 3,500+ active users receiving notifications across 6 different chains. This a remarkable achievement for something launched just in this past year with a very small target audience.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/Orbs-in-2022-Driving-Forces-of-Adoption/image2.jpg" alt="Notifications"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Taking this one step further, the newest and now deployed use case of Orbs operating as an L3 is dTWAP. This is a major step forward for Orbs L3 as it is the first use case that adds capabilities to dApps with significant TVL. First deployed on <a href="https://www.spiritswap.finance/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>SpiritSwap</a>, and now within striking distance of going live on <a href="https://spooky.fi/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>SpookySwap</a> and <a href="https://www.pangolin.exchange/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Pangolin</a>, the entire community can celebrate this achievement and get excited about this integration pipeline. </p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/Orbs-in-2022-Driving-Forces-of-Adoption/image3.jpg" alt="dTWAP"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>In this arena, the project’s goal for 2023 will be to integrate dTWAP with additional major dexes, establish Orbs as a major player in DeFi, and solidify the network’s position as an L3. With these ambitions in mind, a high priority will be to launch other Orbs DeFi layer 3 use cases during 2023.</p><h3 id="launching-orbs-governance"  class='title-h3'
    >Launching Orbs Governance</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In alignment with the project’s core web3 philosophy, Orbs governance was <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-governance/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>introduced</a> and <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/orbs-network.eth" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>launched</a> in August. Since its launch, there have been three governance proposals, some directly affecting Orbs PoS V3, with another in progress. Accounting for all four votes, over 1.5 billion $ORBS participated. This signified the community&#39;s confidence in the project &amp; reflected their high level of engagement.</p><p  class='text-p'>The <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/orbs-network.eth/proposal/0x770671f96d4eca72867acc6b4ce645cbd76e17e47a69f6da28ad9783b1aae930" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>first proposal</a> asked the community if they’d like to reinstate a minimum amount that Guardians (validators) must self-delegate. The vote went down to the wire with just 54% of the vote saying yes and 46% disagreeing. Following the first proposal, the community then voted on the amount minimum self-delegation should be, with 3% self-delegation winning with <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/orbs-network.eth/proposal/0xc2f4c60c94b6955dfd6ccfbfdbd40dc8f516352e015dce0f5deac9186154095f" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>56% of the total vote</a>. </p><p  class='text-p'>The third vote this year was on <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/orbs-network.eth/proposal/0xa347f2d0090ad863d5afb8a20bb2d42e8bbd86a72e34ba915738c6f0cce83e6c" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs improvement proposals</a> which created a forum on <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/OIPs" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>GitHub</a> where anyone in the Orbs ecosystem can suggest improvements to the Orbs protocol and following a discussion can be voted on via Snapshot.</p><h3 id="ton"  class='title-h3'
    >TON</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Lastly, Orbs has further solidified its position as blockchain-agnostic by integrating with the <a href="https://ton.org/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>TON blockchain</a>, the first non-EVM chain the Orbs project is building on. For a brief history lesson, the Durov brothers, the founders of Telegram, released a whitepaper for a blockchain in 2018 and began working on it until 2020 when it was forced to shut down operations by the SEC. However, since it was all open-sourced, a group of enthusiasts continued the project and are now being integrated with Telegram in modern-day 2022.</p><p  class='text-p'>TON has the potential to onboard Telegram’s <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/telegram-statistics/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>500M+</a> monthly active users onto the Blockchain. The approach to integrating Orbs and TON has been to build out core infrastructure components of the network, consult on best practices for L1s, and assist across all aspects of the project when necessary. Orbs recently released <a href="https://www.orbs.com/Announcing-TON-Minter-by-Orbs" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>TON Minter</a>, which became the official way to deploy Jettons on the TON chain (Similar to ERC-20 tokens). Despite launching at the beginning of the month, the tool has already seen significant usage, with 4,300 developers mining more than 470+ tokens. Additionally, Orbs released <a href="https://tonverifier.live/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>TON verifier</a> at the end of the year, which verifies the source code of TON contracts powered by Orbs L3.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/Orbs-in-2022-Driving-Forces-of-Adoption/image4.jpg" alt="TONVerifier"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs team has attended meetups, hackathons, and more in an effort to build a close relationship with the foundation. Tal Kol, Orbs CTO, has become a TON ambassador, showcasing the close ties between Orbs and the foundation. Our goal for Orbs on TON is as the network is further developed, Orbs will be positioned to become a major player in the ecosystem to power decentralized applications. This has huge potential for bringing usage to Orbs, especially if TON can onboard the next generation of users into web3 this coming year.</p><div class='line-separator'> </div>

<p  class='text-p'>In summary, this past year has been a period of significant building and development growth for the Orbs ecosystem. The project has not only achieved all of the goals for this year but also surpassed them in some areas. The entire Orbs community can look forward to continuing the web3 philosophy and establishing Orbs as a major layer-3 throughout the entire blockchain ecosystem in 2023. If you’re in the area, be sure to meet during the Orbs team’s conference attendance in Austin Texas, Korea, Japan, and elsewhere in 2023. </p></div></div></div><div class="blog-element" data-url="../announcing-support-for-ton-connect-2.0-in-minter-and-verifier" data-image="../assets/img/blog/announcing-support-for-ton-connect-2.0-in-minter-and-verifier/bg.jpeg" data-title="Announcing support for TON Connect 2.0 in Minter and Verifier" data-prefix="On" data-date="Dec 29, 2022"><div class="single-blog-header header"><h1 class="single-blog-header-title">Announcing support for TON Connect 2.0 in Minter and Verifier</h1><div class="single-blog-header-author-flex"><div class="single-blog-header-author flex-start"><section class="blog-author-details flex-start"><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/team/members/small/shahar.jpg" alt="Shahar Yakir"></figure>

After months of hard work, the TON community has finally <a href="https://telegra.ph/TON-Connect-20-12-26" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>released TON Connect 2.0</a> (TC2), a major step forward in improving the entire ecosystem.</p><p  class='text-p'>Contributors have followed the protocol standard and have upgraded both TON Minter &amp; TON Verifier to support TON Connect 2.0.</p><h3 id="what-is-ton-connect-and-why-is-it-important-"  class='title-h3'
    >What is TON connect and why is it important?</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In simple terms, TON Connect does the heavy lifting for dApp developers by publishing the list of supporting wallets and their connection details. This allows the dApp developer to create a dynamic list of wallets, each of which works with the same connection and transaction-sending API. This enables the dApp developer to focus on building the app and minimizing wallet-interaction logic to a minimum.</p><p  class='text-p'>From a user perspective, any TON Connect 2.0 compatible wallet can interact with any TON Connect 2.0 compatible dApp. dApps will now be able to retrieve the user&#39;s wallet address and send transactions from the application to the wallet for approval. This will make everything from connecting to usage seamless.</p><p  class='text-p'>Further, TON Connect 2.0 is an entirely open-sourced protocol and allows 3rd party wallet developers to integrate without friction, eliminating walled gardens.</p><h3 id="ton-minter-and-ton-verifier-add-support-for-tc2"  class='title-h3'
    >TON Minter and TON Verifier add support for TC2</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>This announcement follows the release of <a href="https://www.orbs.com/Announcing-TON-Minter-by-Orbs/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>TON Minter</a> and <a href="https://www.orbs.com/Announcing-TON-Verifier-by-Orbs/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>TON Verifier</a>. Both tools are amongst the first to have adopted the TON Connect 2.0 standard, effectively adding the anticipated Tonkeeper support.</p><p  class='text-p'>Minter has already assisted developers in deploying over 450+ Jettons and was added to the TON Foundation&#39;s official domain, while Verifier already covers a large portion (estimated 80%) of the contracts on the TON chain.</p><p  class='text-p'>This means that both of these tools can now be used with Tonkeeper and future TON Connect 2.0 supported wallets. Tonkeeper is one of the most widely used wallets by TON community participants, and we expect usage of both verifier and minter to grow accordingly.</p><p  class='text-p'>We believe it is important that these foundational tools adopt TC2, being an open protocol that supports the decentralization of the ecosystem of TON. This is why we are proud to have been early testers and adoption partners for TC2 and are looking forward to seeing more tools and wallets adopt it in the future.</p></div></div></div></ul></div><div
