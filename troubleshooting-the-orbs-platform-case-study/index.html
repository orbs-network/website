    >Case Study</h3>
<p  class='text-p'><strong><em>Target audience:</em></strong></p><p  class='text-p'><em>Validator DevOps, Orbs contributors and anyone interested in log analysis of the Orbs platform</em></p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'>As new software meets the real world in production for the first time, unforeseen issues pop up. Anyone in the business long enough knows this for a fact.</p><p  class='text-p'>Orbs platform is no different, and while considerable effort was, and still is being expended to retain the highest code quality, post-production incidents do happen, but they provide opportunities to make the software better yet.</p><p  class='text-p'>Part of improving software and keep learning from experience is creating case studies such as this one.</p><p  class='text-p'>This post includes technical notes to help you, the reader, make sense of the information you are seeing. It is not an exhaustive description of Lean Helix or any other service of the Orbs platform. For that, visit the <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-spec" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs Spec</a>.</p><p  class='text-p'>Such was the case that a few weeks post-launch, the Orbs core team observed less than optimal behavior of the Lean Helix consensus algorithm in production. The <a href="https://medium.com/orbs-network/monitoring-the-orbs-platform-orbs-a555109ce66e" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>dashboard</a> showed that frequently, a block passes consensus only on the third attempt, instead of the expected first or second attempt. This meant it took longer to reach consensus and consequently transaction requests took longer to return a result to the caller.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong><em>Technical note:</em></strong></p><p  class='text-p'><em>Before going into more detail, let’s understand a bit how Lean Helix works (with <strong>gross oversimplification</strong>):</em></p><ul>
<li><em>Choose a <strong>Leader</strong> node at random</em></li>
<li><em>The leader collects pending transactions (i.e. transactions sent by clients and still waiting to be included in a block) into a &quot;proposed block&quot;</em></li>
<li><em>The leader suggests this block to the other non-leader nodes</em></li>
<li><em>The non-leader nodes try to reach an agreement (a.k.a consensus) by passing around messages of various types (more on that later) relating to the content of the proposed block. There is a time limit as to how long this can take to propose the block and reach an agreement. If the time limit is exceeded and consensus has still <strong>not</strong> been reached, a <strong>new leader</strong> is chosen among the non-leader nodes (the previous leader itself becomes a non-leader node) and the process <strong>repeats itself</strong>.</em></li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'><em><strong>The above flow is called a View.</strong> The first iteration (view) is denoted V=0, the following iteration (with a new leader) is V=1 and so on. The time limit per View is exponentially increased for every View. For V=0 the leader has 4 seconds to reach consensus (production configuration as of May 2019) before it is replaced. For V=1 the next leader has 8 seconds, for V=2 the next leader has 16 seconds and so on.</em></p><p  class='text-p'><em>When consensus on a block is reached, every node commits the proposed (now accepted) block, the View is reset to V=0 and the process repeats itself.</em></p><p  class='text-p'><em>Read more about Lean Helix:</em> <a href="https://www.orbs.com/orbs-unified-theory-of-randomness-explaining-the-helix-consensus-algorithm/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>Orbs’ Unified Theory of Randomness: Explaining the Helix Consensus Algorithm</em></a></p><p  class='text-p'>Now, given the production configuration, it was expected that the first leader at V=0 will sometimes be able to reach consensus, but mostly the second leader at V=1 will do that (exactly why is out of scope). There was no apparent reason to reach the third leader at V=2 unless there was some considerable network lag.</p><p  class='text-p'>Having said all that, here you can see the problem:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/troubleshooting-the-orbs-platform-case-study/image7.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Instead of having all nodes report they are either on V=0 or V=1, the frequency of V=2 was quite high.</p><p  class='text-p'>So, we started digging deeper.</p><p  class='text-p'>It was clear that a specific node (let&#39;s call it <strong>Node A</strong>, its actual identity is irrelevant to this case study) as exhibiting the majority of V=2 incidents.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/troubleshooting-the-orbs-platform-case-study/image4.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>At this point, the dashboard could not provide further clues. Suffice to say that one of the Orbs core team&#39;s monitoring goals is to improve on what can be easily identified in the context of the dashboard and postpone the following costly log research to more complex issues.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>In this case, logs were the next step.</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>From a troubleshooting perspective, we were fortunate to have frequent V=2 incidents so it was easy to obtain fresh logs around the timeframe of such incidents. It can be quite frustrating trying to debug a rare issue for which logs are not readily available.</p><p  class='text-p'>The logs use the node&#39;s Orbs address for filtering. In node A&#39;s case, it is <strong>&quot;0123456789abcdef&quot;</strong>, sometimes contracted to <strong>&quot;012345&quot;</strong>.</p><p  class='text-p'>Since we did see Node A&#39;s block height advancing we knew it was up to date on the blocks.</p><p  class='text-p'>Now, when a node does not commit a block through the consensus algorithm, it can still receive new blocks via <strong>Block Sync</strong>.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong><em>Technical note:</em></strong></p><p  class='text-p'><em>Block Sync is a service within the node that wakes up after some predetermined time during which no new block was committed. The node assumes that it&#39;s being left behind for whatever reason, so it requests newer blocks from other nodes in the network. This is useful in case the node was down for a while and now needs to sync to the rest of the network. It is also useful in this case, where blocks are not being committed as part of the consensus algorithm.</em></p><p  class='text-p'><em>Read more about Block Sync in Orbs Spec:</em> <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-spec/blob/master/behaviors/services/block-storage.md#inter-node-block-sync-flow" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>Block Sync in Orbs Spec</em></a></p><p  class='text-p'>We suspected that node A was advancing through Block Sync rather than through consensus.</p><p  class='text-p'>So, the initial filter was to show blocks being committed as part of the consensus algorithm flow.</p><p  class='text-p'>Analyzing logs is like looking at the data with various lenses, one at a time, each of which captures only a subset. For logs over some size, there is simply too much data for a human to grasp in one go.</p><p  class='text-p'>So, here is the first screenshot from <strong>logz.io</strong>. In it you can see positive filters (in blue), negative filters (in red) and a search string (logz.io uses the Lucene query format).</p><p  class='text-p'>The PHASE COMMITTED message means the block was committed as part of the consensus algorithm.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>We noticed the lack of node=&quot;012345&quot;</strong> (a shortened version of the node address) - it&#39;s not there, nor before or after this time.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/troubleshooting-the-orbs-platform-case-study/image1.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>This made us assume that no blocks are committed as part of consensus at all, on node A.</p><p  class='text-p'>To make sure this assumption is correct, another search was made.</p><p  class='text-p'>This search confirmed that node A <strong>only</strong> receives blocks via Block Sync. It shows that every block of Node A was received via Block Sync, no exceptions: <strong>&quot;successfully committed block received via sync&quot;:</strong></p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/troubleshooting-the-orbs-platform-case-study/image2.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>As a sanity check, we checked which additional nodes receive this message (that is, don&#39;t commit blocks through consensus algorithm). We found out that other nodes occasionally also receive blocks via Block Sync. It&#39;s ok for this to happen from time to time, but node A showed this for 100% of the blocks.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/troubleshooting-the-orbs-platform-case-study/image10.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>At this point, we established that Node A fails to reach consensus 100% of the time, so it was time to dig into Lean Helix consensus algorithm&#39;s logs to follow Node A&#39;s flow through it and understand what goes wrong.</p><p  class='text-p'>We now focus only on Lean Helix logs to narrow the investigation. All Lean Helix logs have a property called <em>lhlib</em> which is set to true, so it is easy to filter for only these messages by adding a condition that <em>lhlib</em> property exists - see below.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/troubleshooting-the-orbs-platform-case-study/image5.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Let&#39;s focus on a specific block that Node A had to receive from Block Sync, but other nodes managed to commit with consensus: 454927. We obtained this block number from the screenshot with &quot;successfully committed block via sync&quot; messages above.</p><p  class='text-p'>Notice the search string &quot;H=454927&quot; in the screenshot below:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/troubleshooting-the-orbs-platform-case-study/image3.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>We can see that consensus messages are being ignored (such as the outlined <em>COMMIT</em> message in the screenshot above) by Node A, because <em>&quot;PREPREPARE is not stored&quot;</em> (same as &quot;not received at all&quot; for our purposes). To understand what this log message means, here is another technical note:</p><p  class='text-p'><em><strong>Technical note:</strong></em></p><p  class='text-p'><em>When the leader node proposes a block to the other nodes, it does so by broadcasting a PREPREPARE message that contains the block, to the other nodes. Then the other nodes &quot;debate&quot; with one another whether they agree on the proposed block or not, by passing around more message types, such as PREPARE and COMMIT (no need to discuss those here).</em></p><p  class='text-p'><em>PREPREPARE is the initial message sent by the leader and contains the proposed block itself. If it was not received by some other node, that other node will refuse to receive any other subsequent consensus messages related to that block, because there is no point in participating in consensus if the node doesn&#39;t have the proposed block, to begin with.</em></p><p  class='text-p'>Next, it was time to understand <strong>why</strong> <em>PREPREPARE</em> was not received by Node A.</p><p  class='text-p'><em><strong>Yet another technical note:</strong></em></p><p  class='text-p'><em>As we said, the leader of the first view (V=0) sends out a PREPREPARE message that contains the proposed block. Now, if the leader fails to reach a consensus within the time limit, it is replaced by another leader, now at V=1. Here is a twist: usually, that new leader of V=1 will utilize <strong>the same block</strong> proposed by the previous leader (cheaper than creating a new block itself). It will send the reused block to the other nodes within a NEW_VIEW message. That NEW_VIEW message contains within it the previous leader&#39;s PREPREPARE message along with the reused block (essentially the new leader says: &quot;Hey, the last leader&#39;s proposed block was valid, we just didn&#39;t manage to agree in time so let&#39;s try again&quot;)</em></p><p  class='text-p'>Next, it was time to search for where Node A actually received a PREPREPARE (if it did at all) from the leader and find out what went wrong with it. Turns out Node A did receive PREPREPARE from the leader.</p><p  class='text-p'>Here it is, let&#39;s break this screenshot down:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/troubleshooting-the-orbs-platform-case-study/image9.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>At 16:05:23.988, a NEW_VIEW message is received by Node A from the leader of V=1 (sender=&quot;ff33c7&quot;). As explained in the last technical note, this is expected. The next thing that should happen is for Node A to <strong>unpack the internal PREPREPARE message</strong>, and from it, to <strong>unpack the block</strong> and <strong>validate</strong> it.</p><p  class='text-p'>NEW_VIEW was unpacked and its contained PREPREPARE was also unpacked (it&#39;s just not logged), <strong>however</strong> the attempt to validate the contained block <strong>fails, due to the block&#39;s timestamp</strong>. This is weird! no other node failed to validate this block.</p><p  class='text-p'>Let&#39;s understand the outlined error message:</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>currentTimestamp=159df14e0fab5b36</strong> translates to May 12 2019 13:06:03 (with the help of a hex → decimal calculator and <a href="https://currentmillis.com/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>this site</a> that converts millis since Epoch to ISO8601 time string). <strong>prevTimestamp=159df14bde5aed90</strong> translates to May 12 2019 13:05:54.

    >Potential Difficulties</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Naturally, deploying CBDCs involves certain difficulties, especially during the transition phase. Therefore, all relevant authorities and government agencies must be attentive and responsive in order to effectively mitigate issues as they present themselves.</p><p  class='text-p'>Among the potential difficulties we foresee, we expect the impact on the banking industry to be the most significant. As briefly described in prior witings, banks to some extent might experience a liquidity challenge affecting their available credit reserves, thus making credit more expensive through higher interest rates. There could be several paths to alleviate this and increase cash reserves:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Generating new lines of business - The banking industry could undergo a major shakeup as new blockchain-based platforms are deployed, and many traditional (and highly profitable) services will no longer be provided by banks. It will challenge banks to redefine their role in the new economy and to adapt accordingly. While some banks probably see this as a threat, others could use this as an opportunity to grab substantial market share as the demand for new financial services grows. From the general public&#39;s perspective and even the central bank&#39;s, this spur in competition is positive, forcing banks to become more efficient overall.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Central banks are in control of the deposit discount rate, and are therefore in control of the demand for CBDC and for banks&#39; cash reserves. Therefore, the likeliest scenario is one where the central bank will set an interest rate (on CBDC reserves) to reach a new, improved and stable equilibrium. That equilibrium will see only a limited portion of banks&#39; cash reserves flow to CBDC deposits, not most of it and certainly not all of it. As with other similar kinds of economic stabilization measures, it may take some time for the market to readjust, but the market will reach a new and better state, given that the central bank is trusted by the commercial banks</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The role of central banks is to balance several responsibilities in order to maintain a reliable, growing financial market. Providing the option of opening a CBDC account with the central bank makes any person or entity a de facto customer of the central bank. No one actually intends to have them deal directly with the general public, rather they would essentially outsource this service to commercial banks, generating a new line of business and new stream of revenues</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The new CBDC deposit accounts will not be credit facilities. Those will only be provided by commercial banks. Thus banks will focus on offering their customers active financial services rather than just money storage</p></li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>There may be additional difficulties involved in the process of migrating to CBDC, however we will only discuss two more: user privacy and raising sufficient public awareness.</p><p  class='text-p'>Firstly, privacy and anonymity, especially in the context of payment services, will always be a point of contention. On the one hand, many want full domain over their privacy by having the option to use fully anonymous means of payment. On the other hand, such features might be exploited by nefarious actors for illegal activity and tax evasion. As previously noted, CBDCs may provide different levels of user privacy, depending on the central bank&#39;s policy. The most simple solution would be leaving only the lowest value banknotes available, while limiting the allowed value per cash transaction. That would make the transition towards a true cashless economy smoother and quicker. In certain countries, it may even allow policy makers a defense against critics, as not all cash has been abolished.</p><p  class='text-p'>Secondly, getting the public on board may present difficulties. Public awareness campaigns and proper education should mitigate this. We truly believe that any argument that certain parts of the population could not handle this transition and might be victims for potential fraud are patently absurd. Yes, there will be fraudsters and it will take longer for some to &quot;master&quot; the use of digital payments. However, this genuine concern is not reason enough to reject change outright. Had that been the case, there would have been no move to e-banking, internet or mobile devices. Can you imagine our world today without any of them?</p><h3 id="suggested-strategic-outline"  class='title-h3'
    >Suggested Strategic Outline</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In light of the above, and assuming that we have been able to persuade the reader that CBDCs are a powerful instrument that ought to be adopted by central banks, we suggest the following strategy, which calls for a centralized CBDC on a private blockchain protocol but which allows for development into a decentralized protocol - if the technology proves itself to be viable. Deployment would occur in three steps according to this strategy, spread over several years, but starting sooner rather than later. There is no point in indicating the length of each phase, which would be an open question, but we certainly expect a central bank to set reasonable targets on this roadmap and stick to that plan.</p><ol>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 1 - Introducing CBDC Light, for digital payments only. This currency is the light version of the later full-featured centralized CBDC. The general public may open reserve accounts at the central bank, but they will not carry interest and are intended to be used as the central bank&#39;s certified digital wallets. The goal is to introduce the advantages of using digital payment services and reduce the use of cash to a minimum, leaving only the lowest value bills in circulation. This period will allow commercial banks to start getting used to the idea of having a CBDC, knowing that a full-featured CBDC is waiting just around the corner.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 2 - Introducing a full-featured centralized CBDC. Once the public and commercial banks are accustomed to this lighter CBDC, the central bank upgrades it to a full-featured implementation in order to maximize its merits and utilize it as a full monetary instrument. This period involves potential disruptions to the economy, as discussed above. It is up to the central bank to manage the process carefully in order to drive the economy towards its new equilibrium, in which commercial banks are more efficient and generate new revenue streams. In parallel, the central bank during this time closely examines blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets in order to determine when it would be suitable to deploy a decentralized CBDC</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 3 - Discussing decentralization. As noted earlier, we are still not convinced that CBDC decentralization is necessary or ever will be. Still, we urge central banks to think about it, even if just to push the envelope as a thought-experiment, so that as technology advances, they will be in a position to decide if implementation is the correct strategy for them. We are certain that with time, new technology would provide better solutions to problems that we now cannot see being resolved. Central banks should focus their efforts on understanding several key topics which are critical to a decentralized protocol:</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What is the desired level of user privacy and anonymity?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Who are the participating nodes?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>How does the White chain operate?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What are the KYC &amp; AML procedures for opening an account on that chain?</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion"  class='title-h3'
    >Conclusion</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In this series of posts, we have provided a brief overview of CBDCs and why they should be implemented sooner rather than later. Since CBDCs are such a powerful instrument, their implementation must be calculated and methodical in order to maximize their merits and minimize their demerits.</p><p  class='text-p'>The roles and importance of major actors in our global economy are constantly questioned as we head towards a &#39;new economy&#39;. Each and every one of them will have to adapt to technological innovation in order to maintain relevance and in their position of maintaining market stability. The same goes for central banks. Being the economy&#39;s equivalent of the &quot;responsible adults&quot; in the room, they must engage.</p><p  class='text-p'>We support the recent trend of central banks experimenting and considering issuing a CBDC. In our view, central banks that are looking to lead rather than be led, cannot ignore the potential benefits of this opportunity nor the pitfalls of failing to follow what seems like an inevitable culmination of digital economic innovation over the last two decades.</p></div></div></div></ul></div><div class="footer-tweets"><section class="footer-section-title"><img
