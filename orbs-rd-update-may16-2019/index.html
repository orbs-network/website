    ><strong>The Orbs Universe</strong></h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Since the launch of the production-ready Orbs platform and its release to the community, the Orbs core development team has continued to monitor its progress and work to develop improvements to propose to the community of participants in the Orbs network. Our team prepared a post describing what we’ve learned so far, the problems the network has encountered and the fixes we’ve proposed to the Validators running the protocol.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://medium.com/orbs-network/pos-ecosystem-elections-update-orbs-a4063e3d0f05" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Read all about it here</a>.</p><h2 id="-strong-use-cases-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    ><strong>Use cases</strong></h2>
<p  class='text-p'>There’s been a lot of interest among Orbs contributors to implement cool use-cases on top of the platform to show what it’s capable of. Some of these ideas will remain proof of concepts, while others may eventually mature to working products as an increasing number of companies in the ecosystem express interest to take them to the next level. The Orbs core development team believes that the focus of this exploration should be to work on the use-cases that have the potential to derive the most significant utility from a public blockchain, mainly by benefiting from the various guarantees Tal (@talkol) writes about (auditability, forkability, governance). See here [<a href="https://medium.com/orbs-network/the-blockchain-dichotomy-and-an-architecture-to-overcome-it-8b124cf1cad" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>link</a>] Some of the use-cases the Orbs core development team believes have this type of potential are the following:</p><h3 id="decentralized-npm"  class='title-h3'
    >Decentralized NPM</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Node.js Package Manager (NPM) is a super popular tool for sharing code between projects in the JavaScript ecosystem. It hosts over <a href="https://registry.npmjs.org/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>1.2M</a> packages that are downloaded over <a href="https://api.npmjs.org/downloads/point/2019-05-06" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>1B</a> times per day. This database is open-source but what’s interesting is that it’s completely centralized and managed by a well-known company called npm Inc.</p><p  class='text-p'>Currently, it fulfills two important roles: 1) authority and 2) storage.</p><p  class='text-p'>Firstly, npm Inc. authenticates users who can publish new versions of packages and manages their permissions. Secondly, it hosts and maintains the registry where packages are stored.</p><p  class='text-p'>Sergey (@<a href="https://github.com/bolshchikov" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>bolshchikov</a>), one of the core contributors, is a die-hard JavaScript ecosystem fan, incepted proof of concept of a <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/decentralized-npm" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>decentralized npm</a> can address both roles by utilizing smart contracts and public blockchain.</p><p  class='text-p'>A smart contract allows the decentralized npm to easily manage the authority and role of every user publishing code in a transparent manner. It also makes it possible to store and audit the metadata of packages that are being published.</p><h3 id="conversation-app"  class='title-h3'
    >Conversation App</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Kirill (@<a href="https://github.com/netoneko" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>netoneko</a>) created Conversation (<a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/conversation" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/conversation</a>) - a serverless chat running on top of the Orbs blockchain.

    ><strong>Orbs Network</strong></h2>
<p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><strong>Orbs Network Github</strong></a></p><p  class='text-p'>During April we’ve worked a lot on monitoring and stabilizing Orbs network:</p><ul>
<li>Extracted logger to separate library, Scribe: <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/scribe" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/scribe</a></li>
<li>Added support for Prometheus metrics exposed via HTTP API.</li>
<li>Added config validation for the node that verifies that Orbs node address was derived from the public key. It addresses the issue of misconfiguration that one of our partners had experienced.</li>
<li>Streamlined release process for Gamma and Orbs node, master and releases are published to Docker Hub now.</li>
<li>Network launch - logs monitoring and understanding the network &#39;heartbeat&#39;<ul>
<li>Ethereum health-check (github <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/issues/1102" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#1102</a>) - refactored the component to be testable, added a sanity test, refactored the reporting code to send less data or more concise data about the health checking</li>
<li>native compiler (github <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/issues/1106" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#1106</a>) - added 6 new metrics to give us visibility about contract compilation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Monitoring data - added/fixed metrics to native compiler and Ethereum health check</li>
<li>Reporting block-sync issues - injected the sync peer IP into the connection context object, so we can report the peer IP and not just the peer address (github <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/issues/1123" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#1123</a>)</li>
<li>Analyzed new transport limitations to resolve invalid network communications (github <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/issues/1153" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#1153</a>)</li>
<li>Worked with Logz.io to understand our limitations and ensure we do not get blocked and &#39;blinded&#39; when it comes to logs of the system</li>
<li>Added state diff discrepancy dump in case Validators disagree on the proposed block’s state diff. This is an interesting case, described <a href="https://medium.com/orbs-network/pos-ecosystem-elections-update-orbs-a4063e3d0f05" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>here</a>, where Orbs nodes didn’t reach a consensus and the Orbs team investigated the cause. Once the team realized it’s because of non-deterministic execution, we proposed this feature.</li>
<li>Removed logging of metrics to log files. Monitoring now relies on metrics polling over via http requests rather than logs parsing</li>
<li>Several issues: <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/issues/1121" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#1121</a>, <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/issues/973" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#973</a></li>
<li>Introduced GOSSIP_RECONNECT_INTERVAL config variable. Previously, when a connection could not be established we would sleep for GOSSIP_CONNECTION_KEEP_ALIVE_INTERVAL before the next attempt. This use of keep-alive-interval to determine the sleep between reconnection is incorrect in itself. The problem appeared when, in some testing scenarios, keep-alive messages are disabled by setting the keep-alive-interval to a very high value. In these scenarios, if a transport listener is not initialized before the first connection attempt, the test would halt because the reconnect interval was a virtually infinite duration.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-strong-gamma-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    ><strong>Gamma</strong></h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Gamma is a local environment that enables developers to develop, deploy and test on Orbs layer. You can read about it <a href="https://medium.com/orbs-network/orbs-launches-gamma-local-testing-environment-ahead-of-2019-production-launch-ee0ac277544e" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>here</a> and start playing with it <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/gamma-cli" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>here</a>.</p><ul>
<li>We added an option to gamma server to use LeanHelix consensus. This means that Gamma server can now run with 2 different consensus algorithms:<ol>
<li>Benchmark consensus: optimized for fastest block time and lowest resource requirements and assumes trust among the nodes. It is useful for contract development.</li>
<li>Lean Helix consensus: random leader consensus based on PBFT, lean helix is Byzantine Fault Tolerant and is the consensus algorithm Orbs network is running in production.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A new version of Gamma CLI also automatically runs Prism, the Orbs blockchain explorer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-strong-orbs-ethereum-contracts-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    ><strong>Orbs Ethereum Contracts</strong></h2>
<p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-ethereum-contracts" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><strong>Orbs Ethereum Contracts Github</strong></a></p><p  class='text-p'>This monorepo contains projects involving Orbs and Ethereum interoperability features. During the development of V1 the Orbs team started experiencing the challenges involved in testing, building, and deploying features that span across more than one blockchain.</p><p  class='text-p'>All subrepos contain Solidity contracts for deployment on Ethereum. Some contain Orbs contracts, and some contain additional standalone processes meant to facilitate communications between the two networks. In addition, some subrepos include off-chain apps such as web UI.</p><p  class='text-p'>The stack used in these repositories is diverse:</p><ol>
<li>Solidity contracts unit tests are implemented in JS over Truffle</li>
<li>Orbs contracts and their unit tests are implemented in Golang</li>
<li>Integration tests demonstrating full life cycles for all features are implemented using a mixed stack of JS, Truffle, Golang, Gamms, and bash</li>
</ol>
<p  class='text-p'>The monorepo currently contains 3 + 1 subrepos:</p><ol>
<li>Subscription - Contracts for provisioning and payments for Orbs Virtual Chains</li>
<li>ASB - Autonomous Swap Bridge - enable ERC20 token transfers between Ethereum and Obrs networks</li>
<li>Voting - Contracts for delegation, voting, Guardian and Validator registration, and voting over Ethereum and contracts for tallying elections results and executing their results on Orbs. In addition, there is an external process which drives data flow between the two networks.</li>
<li>Deprecated - Federation contracts. Reference for the deprecated federation model envisioned in the original Orbs Position Paper, since replaced with Orbs PoS model.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="refactor-cleanup"  class='title-h3'
    >Refactor / cleanup</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>When V1 was released, each of the subrepos had a different internal structure, following different conventions. In addition, the directory structure was confusing since the repository was not initially conceived as a monorepo. The refactor/cleanup included:</p><ol>
<li>Separation into subrepos - now, each top level folder represents a single subrepo corresponding to a single feature</li>
<li>Added shebang lines to bash scripts</li>
<li>Removed non repo folders from repo top level - scatter docker folders into subfolders</li>
<li>Stop using NPM symlinks</li>
<li>Uniform subrepo structure, with these folders:<ol>
<li>Docker - used for ci automation</li>
<li>Ethereum - truffle folder containing Ethereum contracts</li>
<li>Orbs - Orbs contracts project</li>
<li>ff-blockchain components - such as web UI projects, schedulers, cron jobs, etc</li>
<li>Build - build artifacts output for all projects, in particular, compiled Ethereum contracts</li>
<li>Test<ol>
<li>End-to-end (e2e) - undetermined scope</li>
<li>Integration Test - integration e2e tests testing the full feature against both Ethereum and Orbs implementations: local dev (Gamma/Ganache), testnet (Ropsten/Testnet), production (Mainnets)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="open-issues"  class='title-h3'
    >Open Issues</h3>
<ol>
<li>ABS project still makes a distinction between Ganache and Ropsten target networks in testing code. This is a technical debt</li>
<li>Dependencies between subrepos are not yet resolved. Currently, Ethereum contracts must be compiled and published using ./deploy.sh script found in the truffle project folder, or manually</li>
<li>Integration test stack is too complex.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="-strong-performance-monitoring-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    ><strong>Performance monitoring</strong></h2>
<p  class='text-p'>In the weeks leading up to our planned launch, the Orbs core team ran stability tests on various network configurations. The purpose was twofold: identify bugs that manifest themselves only after the system has been online for a long time, and test the load limits of the system.</p><p  class='text-p'>As a new software system goes to Production it is essential to have a monitoring system in place. Its main goal is to identify anomalies, that is, deviations from the KPIs that have been set for the system. This information should optimally be presented in a clear format so that a casual glance at a performance dashboard lets users identify an &quot;All OK&quot; or &quot;Not all OK&quot; status.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://www.orbs.com/monitoring-the-orbs-platform/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Read all about it here.</a></p><h2 id="-strong-prism-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'

    >New Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added new <strong>/contract</strong> page with the contract code, and the 100 latest transactions sorted by block height and index in the block. This page can be used to monitor incoming transactions to a specific contract and the results of each transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/orbs-rd-update-may16-2019/image2-2.png" alt=""></figure></p><ul>
<li>Added a link to the contract page from the transactions page.</li>

Since the Orbs POS ecosystem is based on Ethereum, Boyar &amp; Nebula must have up to date state from Ethereum in order to operate.

    >Research</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>The Orbs team is also engaged in theoretical research that we believe the community of developers may find useful in the future development of the Orbs network. The below summarizes some of what we have been thinking about and working on lately.</p><h3 id="-strong-zero-knowledge-proofs-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>Zero Knowledge Proofs</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>A key factor in mainstream application&#39; adoption is the ability to provide users with the required privacy. The ability to achieve privacy with the ability to maintain state under consensus and provide the auditability and forkability guarantees is challenging. Multiple cryptographic technologies for privacy solutions are under research, such as zero-knowledge proofs, bulletproofs, multi-party computation and others. We’ve chosen to focus our research initially on zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p  class='text-p'>Zero-knowledge proofs are a cutting-edge cryptographic tool. They allow an entity to provide proof of some claim, without revealing any other information other than the validity of the claim itself. A popular Blockchain-related use case is the privacy coin Zcash, where zero-knowledge proofs are used in the following way: A payer, rather than uploading a transaction, uploads a “proof” of correct transaction. All verifying nodes of the system may then check that the underlying transaction is valid, without learning who is the payer, what is the amount being paid and to whom. Moreover, they are able to update the transaction pool accordingly, thus fulfilling their role as system maintainers without jeopardizing the privacy of the users.</p><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs research team continually explores all aspects of zero-knowledge proofs, from theory to implementation. We study the cutting edge protocols for zero-knowledge proofs and examine whether it is possible to bootstrap the unique Orbs network architecture to gain further improvements. Parallely, we research use-cases where zero-knowledge proofs present themselves as a key tool. An example we have recently been focused on is digital identification, a problem with immense implications. In the upcoming Hackathon, we hope to show a proof of concept for a blockchain identification scheme, the core tool of which are zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://zkproof.org/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>ZKProof.org</a> is an open initiative of industry and academia to standardize the security, implementation, and application of zero-knowledge proofs. In early April, a standardization workshop was held at Berkeley. It gathered experts from around the world, both from the industry and academia. The Orbs core team was represented by its lead cryptographer Idan Perl.</p><h3 id="-strong-non-deterministic-execution-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>Non-Deterministic Execution</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The Orbs team is actively researching the topic of non-deterministic execution support in smart-contracts, to expand our platform capabilities. Non-deterministic execution provides two important capabilities. The first is the ability to reach a consensus on data external to the system, which can vary by nature (such as location or a stock price). The second is the ability to identify and remove transactions that result in unintentional non-deterministic execution allowing the block to reach consensus. For example, the non-deterministic state order writes that occurred in the elections contract due to the use of Golang maps.</p><p  class='text-p'>Most existing blockchains solutions follow the active state machine replication approach, in which clients` operations are ordered and then executed. Here, the backend service distributes the application over multiple servers to enhance the resilience of a client-server application for tolerating arbitrary faults, misbehavior (under certain assumptions, such as honest majority). In this approach, if all servers start from the same state, process and execute the same sequence of operations, then they all maintain a single consistent state.</p><p  class='text-p'>This design requires the execution of an operation to be deterministic. If the servers process a smart-contract which includes a source of non-determinism, such as randomness, or outside the system data, the result of the operation will differ across servers causing them to diverge, and prevent state progress.</p><p  class='text-p'>The common approach in blockchain systems for dealing with non-deterministic execution is suppression. Ethereum developed its own execution environment (EVM) along with the Solidity programming language which goes a great length to eradicate all traces of non-determinism (for example allocating variables in memory in known addresses).</p><p  class='text-p'>This approach hinders adoption - for example, by developers which are used to different General-purpose languages, and prevents robust and interesting features in the application which runs on top.</p><p  class='text-p'>There are several traditional approaches in distributed systems research, to support non-deterministic execution - rely on a trusted source of randomness - or even Hyperledger fabric blockchain platform design, which altered the operation processing sequence - execution first, then ordering and final validation phase.</p><p  class='text-p'>We continue to research possible approaches to embedding the support for non-deterministic execution in the Orbs platform.</p><h3 id="randomness"  class='title-h3'
    >Randomness</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The Orbs research team is working on completing a paper on the topic of generating randomness.</p><p  class='text-p'>Apps that require randomness stand in front of a dilemma. If they become transparent, they lose their ability to generate randomness easily. If they remain obscure, users don&#39;t have a good reason to trust the app (other than reputation, that can&#39;t be based on much). Since the randomness can have great economic implications (by determining the winners of valuable prizes), it could be very profitable to tweak the randomness, predict it, or block its publication. How does an app guarantee (not promise!) the integrity of the randomness generation process it uses?</p><p  class='text-p'>Our paper introduces a randomness generation service in a game-theoretic environment that an app can use. Intuitively, it can be seen as a “randomness-as-a-service” type solution.  Randomness is produced on-demand (rather than as a beacon), instantly (without inherent delay built in), and counters collusion.</p><p  class='text-p'>A reliable randomness generation process might be useful for the Orbs network one day -- selecting transactions fairly in high load periods, selecting committees fairly (among a large network of validators).</p><h2 id="-strong-going-on-tour-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'

    >Potential Difficulties</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Naturally, deploying CBDCs involves certain difficulties, especially during the transition phase. Therefore, all relevant authorities and government agencies must be attentive and responsive in order to effectively mitigate issues as they present themselves.</p><p  class='text-p'>Among the potential difficulties we foresee, we expect the impact on the banking industry to be the most significant. As briefly described in prior witings, banks to some extent might experience a liquidity challenge affecting their available credit reserves, thus making credit more expensive through higher interest rates. There could be several paths to alleviate this and increase cash reserves:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Generating new lines of business - The banking industry could undergo a major shakeup as new blockchain-based platforms are deployed, and many traditional (and highly profitable) services will no longer be provided by banks. It will challenge banks to redefine their role in the new economy and to adapt accordingly. While some banks probably see this as a threat, others could use this as an opportunity to grab substantial market share as the demand for new financial services grows. From the general public&#39;s perspective and even the central bank&#39;s, this spur in competition is positive, forcing banks to become more efficient overall.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Central banks are in control of the deposit discount rate, and are therefore in control of the demand for CBDC and for banks&#39; cash reserves. Therefore, the likeliest scenario is one where the central bank will set an interest rate (on CBDC reserves) to reach a new, improved and stable equilibrium. That equilibrium will see only a limited portion of banks&#39; cash reserves flow to CBDC deposits, not most of it and certainly not all of it. As with other similar kinds of economic stabilization measures, it may take some time for the market to readjust, but the market will reach a new and better state, given that the central bank is trusted by the commercial banks</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The role of central banks is to balance several responsibilities in order to maintain a reliable, growing financial market. Providing the option of opening a CBDC account with the central bank makes any person or entity a de facto customer of the central bank. No one actually intends to have them deal directly with the general public, rather they would essentially outsource this service to commercial banks, generating a new line of business and new stream of revenues</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>The new CBDC deposit accounts will not be credit facilities. Those will only be provided by commercial banks. Thus banks will focus on offering their customers active financial services rather than just money storage</p></li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>There may be additional difficulties involved in the process of migrating to CBDC, however we will only discuss two more: user privacy and raising sufficient public awareness.</p><p  class='text-p'>Firstly, privacy and anonymity, especially in the context of payment services, will always be a point of contention. On the one hand, many want full domain over their privacy by having the option to use fully anonymous means of payment. On the other hand, such features might be exploited by nefarious actors for illegal activity and tax evasion. As previously noted, CBDCs may provide different levels of user privacy, depending on the central bank&#39;s policy. The most simple solution would be leaving only the lowest value banknotes available, while limiting the allowed value per cash transaction. That would make the transition towards a true cashless economy smoother and quicker. In certain countries, it may even allow policy makers a defense against critics, as not all cash has been abolished.</p><p  class='text-p'>Secondly, getting the public on board may present difficulties. Public awareness campaigns and proper education should mitigate this. We truly believe that any argument that certain parts of the population could not handle this transition and might be victims for potential fraud are patently absurd. Yes, there will be fraudsters and it will take longer for some to &quot;master&quot; the use of digital payments. However, this genuine concern is not reason enough to reject change outright. Had that been the case, there would have been no move to e-banking, internet or mobile devices. Can you imagine our world today without any of them?</p><h3 id="suggested-strategic-outline"  class='title-h3'
    >Suggested Strategic Outline</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In light of the above, and assuming that we have been able to persuade the reader that CBDCs are a powerful instrument that ought to be adopted by central banks, we suggest the following strategy, which calls for a centralized CBDC on a private blockchain protocol but which allows for development into a decentralized protocol - if the technology proves itself to be viable. Deployment would occur in three steps according to this strategy, spread over several years, but starting sooner rather than later. There is no point in indicating the length of each phase, which would be an open question, but we certainly expect a central bank to set reasonable targets on this roadmap and stick to that plan.</p><ol>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 1 - Introducing CBDC Light, for digital payments only. This currency is the light version of the later full-featured centralized CBDC. The general public may open reserve accounts at the central bank, but they will not carry interest and are intended to be used as the central bank&#39;s certified digital wallets. The goal is to introduce the advantages of using digital payment services and reduce the use of cash to a minimum, leaving only the lowest value bills in circulation. This period will allow commercial banks to start getting used to the idea of having a CBDC, knowing that a full-featured CBDC is waiting just around the corner.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 2 - Introducing a full-featured centralized CBDC. Once the public and commercial banks are accustomed to this lighter CBDC, the central bank upgrades it to a full-featured implementation in order to maximize its merits and utilize it as a full monetary instrument. This period involves potential disruptions to the economy, as discussed above. It is up to the central bank to manage the process carefully in order to drive the economy towards its new equilibrium, in which commercial banks are more efficient and generate new revenue streams. In parallel, the central bank during this time closely examines blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets in order to determine when it would be suitable to deploy a decentralized CBDC</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Phase 3 - Discussing decentralization. As noted earlier, we are still not convinced that CBDC decentralization is necessary or ever will be. Still, we urge central banks to think about it, even if just to push the envelope as a thought-experiment, so that as technology advances, they will be in a position to decide if implementation is the correct strategy for them. We are certain that with time, new technology would provide better solutions to problems that we now cannot see being resolved. Central banks should focus their efforts on understanding several key topics which are critical to a decentralized protocol:</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What is the desired level of user privacy and anonymity?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Who are the participating nodes?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>How does the White chain operate?</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>What are the KYC &amp; AML procedures for opening an account on that chain?</p></li>
</ol>

    >Conclusion</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In this series of posts, we have provided a brief overview of CBDCs and why they should be implemented sooner rather than later. Since CBDCs are such a powerful instrument, their implementation must be calculated and methodical in order to maximize their merits and minimize their demerits.</p><p  class='text-p'>The roles and importance of major actors in our global economy are constantly questioned as we head towards a &#39;new economy&#39;. Each and every one of them will have to adapt to technological innovation in order to maintain relevance and in their position of maintaining market stability. The same goes for central banks. Being the economy&#39;s equivalent of the &quot;responsible adults&quot; in the room, they must engage.</p><p  class='text-p'>We support the recent trend of central banks experimenting and considering issuing a CBDC. In our view, central banks that are looking to lead rather than be led, cannot ignore the potential benefits of this opportunity nor the pitfalls of failing to follow what seems like an inevitable culmination of digital economic innovation over the last two decades.</p></div></div></div></ul></div><div class="footer-tweets"><section class="footer-section-title"><img
