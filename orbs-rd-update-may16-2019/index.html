    ><strong>The Orbs Universe</strong></h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Since the launch of the production-ready Orbs platform and its release to the community, the Orbs core development team has continued to monitor its progress and work to develop improvements to propose to the community of participants in the Orbs network. Our team prepared a post describing what we’ve learned so far, the problems the network has encountered and the fixes we’ve proposed to the Validators running the protocol.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://medium.com/orbs-network/pos-ecosystem-elections-update-orbs-a4063e3d0f05" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Read all about it here</a>.</p><h2 id="-strong-use-cases-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    ><strong>Use cases</strong></h2>
<p  class='text-p'>There’s been a lot of interest among Orbs contributors to implement cool use-cases on top of the platform to show what it’s capable of. Some of these ideas will remain proof of concepts, while others may eventually mature to working products as an increasing number of companies in the ecosystem express interest to take them to the next level. The Orbs core development team believes that the focus of this exploration should be to work on the use-cases that have the potential to derive the most significant utility from a public blockchain, mainly by benefiting from the various guarantees Tal (@talkol) writes about (auditability, forkability, governance). See here [<a href="https://medium.com/orbs-network/the-blockchain-dichotomy-and-an-architecture-to-overcome-it-8b124cf1cad" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>link</a>] Some of the use-cases the Orbs core development team believes have this type of potential are the following:</p><h3 id="decentralized-npm"  class='title-h3'
    >Decentralized NPM</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Node.js Package Manager (NPM) is a super popular tool for sharing code between projects in the JavaScript ecosystem. It hosts over <a href="https://registry.npmjs.org/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>1.2M</a> packages that are downloaded over <a href="https://api.npmjs.org/downloads/point/2019-05-06" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>1B</a> times per day. This database is open-source but what’s interesting is that it’s completely centralized and managed by a well-known company called npm Inc.</p><p  class='text-p'>Currently, it fulfills two important roles: 1) authority and 2) storage.</p><p  class='text-p'>Firstly, npm Inc. authenticates users who can publish new versions of packages and manages their permissions. Secondly, it hosts and maintains the registry where packages are stored.</p><p  class='text-p'>Sergey (@<a href="https://github.com/bolshchikov" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>bolshchikov</a>), one of the core contributors, is a die-hard JavaScript ecosystem fan, incepted proof of concept of a <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/decentralized-npm" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>decentralized npm</a> can address both roles by utilizing smart contracts and public blockchain.</p><p  class='text-p'>A smart contract allows the decentralized npm to easily manage the authority and role of every user publishing code in a transparent manner. It also makes it possible to store and audit the metadata of packages that are being published.</p><h3 id="conversation-app"  class='title-h3'
    >Conversation App</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Kirill (@<a href="https://github.com/netoneko" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>netoneko</a>) created Conversation (<a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/conversation" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/conversation</a>) - a serverless chat running on top of the Orbs blockchain.

    ><strong>Orbs Network</strong></h2>
<p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><strong>Orbs Network Github</strong></a></p><p  class='text-p'>During April we’ve worked a lot on monitoring and stabilizing Orbs network:</p><ul>
<li>Extracted logger to separate library, Scribe: <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/scribe" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/scribe</a></li>
<li>Added support for Prometheus metrics exposed via HTTP API.</li>
<li>Added config validation for the node that verifies that Orbs node address was derived from the public key. It addresses the issue of misconfiguration that one of our partners had experienced.</li>
<li>Streamlined release process for Gamma and Orbs node, master and releases are published to Docker Hub now.</li>
<li>Network launch - logs monitoring and understanding the network &#39;heartbeat&#39;<ul>
<li>Ethereum health-check (github <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/issues/1102" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#1102</a>) - refactored the component to be testable, added a sanity test, refactored the reporting code to send less data or more concise data about the health checking</li>
<li>native compiler (github <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/issues/1106" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#1106</a>) - added 6 new metrics to give us visibility about contract compilation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Monitoring data - added/fixed metrics to native compiler and Ethereum health check</li>
<li>Reporting block-sync issues - injected the sync peer IP into the connection context object, so we can report the peer IP and not just the peer address (github <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/issues/1123" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#1123</a>)</li>
<li>Analyzed new transport limitations to resolve invalid network communications (github <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/issues/1153" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#1153</a>)</li>
<li>Worked with Logz.io to understand our limitations and ensure we do not get blocked and &#39;blinded&#39; when it comes to logs of the system</li>
<li>Added state diff discrepancy dump in case Validators disagree on the proposed block’s state diff. This is an interesting case, described <a href="https://medium.com/orbs-network/pos-ecosystem-elections-update-orbs-a4063e3d0f05" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>here</a>, where Orbs nodes didn’t reach a consensus and the Orbs team investigated the cause. Once the team realized it’s because of non-deterministic execution, we proposed this feature.</li>
<li>Removed logging of metrics to log files. Monitoring now relies on metrics polling over via http requests rather than logs parsing</li>
<li>Several issues: <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/issues/1121" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#1121</a>, <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/issues/973" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#973</a></li>
<li>Introduced GOSSIP_RECONNECT_INTERVAL config variable. Previously, when a connection could not be established we would sleep for GOSSIP_CONNECTION_KEEP_ALIVE_INTERVAL before the next attempt. This use of keep-alive-interval to determine the sleep between reconnection is incorrect in itself. The problem appeared when, in some testing scenarios, keep-alive messages are disabled by setting the keep-alive-interval to a very high value. In these scenarios, if a transport listener is not initialized before the first connection attempt, the test would halt because the reconnect interval was a virtually infinite duration.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-strong-gamma-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    ><strong>Gamma</strong></h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Gamma is a local environment that enables developers to develop, deploy and test on Orbs layer. You can read about it <a href="https://medium.com/orbs-network/orbs-launches-gamma-local-testing-environment-ahead-of-2019-production-launch-ee0ac277544e" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>here</a> and start playing with it <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/gamma-cli" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>here</a>.</p><ul>
<li>We added an option to gamma server to use LeanHelix consensus. This means that Gamma server can now run with 2 different consensus algorithms:<ol>
<li>Benchmark consensus: optimized for fastest block time and lowest resource requirements and assumes trust among the nodes. It is useful for contract development.</li>
<li>Lean Helix consensus: random leader consensus based on PBFT, lean helix is Byzantine Fault Tolerant and is the consensus algorithm Orbs network is running in production.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A new version of Gamma CLI also automatically runs Prism, the Orbs blockchain explorer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-strong-orbs-ethereum-contracts-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    ><strong>Orbs Ethereum Contracts</strong></h2>
<p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-ethereum-contracts" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><strong>Orbs Ethereum Contracts Github</strong></a></p><p  class='text-p'>This monorepo contains projects involving Orbs and Ethereum interoperability features. During the development of V1 the Orbs team started experiencing the challenges involved in testing, building, and deploying features that span across more than one blockchain.</p><p  class='text-p'>All subrepos contain Solidity contracts for deployment on Ethereum. Some contain Orbs contracts, and some contain additional standalone processes meant to facilitate communications between the two networks. In addition, some subrepos include off-chain apps such as web UI.</p><p  class='text-p'>The stack used in these repositories is diverse:</p><ol>
<li>Solidity contracts unit tests are implemented in JS over Truffle</li>
<li>Orbs contracts and their unit tests are implemented in Golang</li>
<li>Integration tests demonstrating full life cycles for all features are implemented using a mixed stack of JS, Truffle, Golang, Gamms, and bash</li>
</ol>
<p  class='text-p'>The monorepo currently contains 3 + 1 subrepos:</p><ol>
<li>Subscription - Contracts for provisioning and payments for Orbs Virtual Chains</li>
<li>ASB - Autonomous Swap Bridge - enable ERC20 token transfers between Ethereum and Obrs networks</li>
<li>Voting - Contracts for delegation, voting, Guardian and Validator registration, and voting over Ethereum and contracts for tallying elections results and executing their results on Orbs. In addition, there is an external process which drives data flow between the two networks.</li>
<li>Deprecated - Federation contracts. Reference for the deprecated federation model envisioned in the original Orbs Position Paper, since replaced with Orbs PoS model.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="refactor-cleanup"  class='title-h3'
    >Refactor / cleanup</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>When V1 was released, each of the subrepos had a different internal structure, following different conventions. In addition, the directory structure was confusing since the repository was not initially conceived as a monorepo. The refactor/cleanup included:</p><ol>
<li>Separation into subrepos - now, each top level folder represents a single subrepo corresponding to a single feature</li>
<li>Added shebang lines to bash scripts</li>
<li>Removed non repo folders from repo top level - scatter docker folders into subfolders</li>
<li>Stop using NPM symlinks</li>
<li>Uniform subrepo structure, with these folders:<ol>
<li>Docker - used for ci automation</li>
<li>Ethereum - truffle folder containing Ethereum contracts</li>
<li>Orbs - Orbs contracts project</li>
<li>ff-blockchain components - such as web UI projects, schedulers, cron jobs, etc</li>
<li>Build - build artifacts output for all projects, in particular, compiled Ethereum contracts</li>
<li>Test<ol>
<li>End-to-end (e2e) - undetermined scope</li>
<li>Integration Test - integration e2e tests testing the full feature against both Ethereum and Orbs implementations: local dev (Gamma/Ganache), testnet (Ropsten/Testnet), production (Mainnets)</li>

    ><strong>Performance monitoring</strong></h2>
<p  class='text-p'>In the weeks leading up to our planned launch, the Orbs core team ran stability tests on various network configurations. The purpose was twofold: identify bugs that manifest themselves only after the system has been online for a long time, and test the load limits of the system.</p><p  class='text-p'>As a new software system goes to Production it is essential to have a monitoring system in place. Its main goal is to identify anomalies, that is, deviations from the KPIs that have been set for the system. This information should optimally be presented in a clear format so that a casual glance at a performance dashboard lets users identify an &quot;All OK&quot; or &quot;Not all OK&quot; status.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://www.orbs.com/monitoring-the-orbs-platform/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Read all about it here.</a></p><h2 id="-strong-prism-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'

    >New Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added new <strong>/contract</strong> page with the contract code, and the 100 latest transactions sorted by block height and index in the block. This page can be used to monitor incoming transactions to a specific contract and the results of each transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/orbs-rd-update-may16-2019/image2-2.png" alt=""></figure></p><ul>
<li>Added a link to the contract page from the transactions page.</li>
<li>Detecting system contracts, and indicating that on the client (Without the code)</li>
<li>Changed <strong>blockHeight</strong> to a number (In the db), instead of string to be able to sort transactions history for the contract page. Client should still use string as it doesn’t support bigint.</li>
<li>Added contract Golang syntax highlighting.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="server-side-enhancements"  class='title-h4'
    >Server-side enhancements</h4>
<ul>

    >Research</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>The Orbs team is also engaged in theoretical research that we believe the community of developers may find useful in the future development of the Orbs network. The below summarizes some of what we have been thinking about and working on lately.</p><h3 id="-strong-zero-knowledge-proofs-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>Zero Knowledge Proofs</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>A key factor in mainstream application&#39; adoption is the ability to provide users with the required privacy. The ability to achieve privacy with the ability to maintain state under consensus and provide the auditability and forkability guarantees is challenging. Multiple cryptographic technologies for privacy solutions are under research, such as zero-knowledge proofs, bulletproofs, multi-party computation and others. We’ve chosen to focus our research initially on zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p  class='text-p'>Zero-knowledge proofs are a cutting-edge cryptographic tool. They allow an entity to provide proof of some claim, without revealing any other information other than the validity of the claim itself. A popular Blockchain-related use case is the privacy coin Zcash, where zero-knowledge proofs are used in the following way: A payer, rather than uploading a transaction, uploads a “proof” of correct transaction. All verifying nodes of the system may then check that the underlying transaction is valid, without learning who is the payer, what is the amount being paid and to whom. Moreover, they are able to update the transaction pool accordingly, thus fulfilling their role as system maintainers without jeopardizing the privacy of the users.</p><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs research team continually explores all aspects of zero-knowledge proofs, from theory to implementation. We study the cutting edge protocols for zero-knowledge proofs and examine whether it is possible to bootstrap the unique Orbs network architecture to gain further improvements. Parallely, we research use-cases where zero-knowledge proofs present themselves as a key tool. An example we have recently been focused on is digital identification, a problem with immense implications. In the upcoming Hackathon, we hope to show a proof of concept for a blockchain identification scheme, the core tool of which are zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://zkproof.org/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>ZKProof.org</a> is an open initiative of industry and academia to standardize the security, implementation, and application of zero-knowledge proofs. In early April, a standardization workshop was held at Berkeley. It gathered experts from around the world, both from the industry and academia. The Orbs core team was represented by its lead cryptographer Idan Perl.</p><h3 id="-strong-non-deterministic-execution-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>Non-Deterministic Execution</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The Orbs team is actively researching the topic of non-deterministic execution support in smart-contracts, to expand our platform capabilities. Non-deterministic execution provides two important capabilities. The first is the ability to reach a consensus on data external to the system, which can vary by nature (such as location or a stock price). The second is the ability to identify and remove transactions that result in unintentional non-deterministic execution allowing the block to reach consensus. For example, the non-deterministic state order writes that occurred in the elections contract due to the use of Golang maps.</p><p  class='text-p'>Most existing blockchains solutions follow the active state machine replication approach, in which clients` operations are ordered and then executed. Here, the backend service distributes the application over multiple servers to enhance the resilience of a client-server application for tolerating arbitrary faults, misbehavior (under certain assumptions, such as honest majority). In this approach, if all servers start from the same state, process and execute the same sequence of operations, then they all maintain a single consistent state.</p><p  class='text-p'>This design requires the execution of an operation to be deterministic. If the servers process a smart-contract which includes a source of non-determinism, such as randomness, or outside the system data, the result of the operation will differ across servers causing them to diverge, and prevent state progress.</p><p  class='text-p'>The common approach in blockchain systems for dealing with non-deterministic execution is suppression. Ethereum developed its own execution environment (EVM) along with the Solidity programming language which goes a great length to eradicate all traces of non-determinism (for example allocating variables in memory in known addresses).</p><p  class='text-p'>This approach hinders adoption - for example, by developers which are used to different General-purpose languages, and prevents robust and interesting features in the application which runs on top.</p><p  class='text-p'>There are several traditional approaches in distributed systems research, to support non-deterministic execution - rely on a trusted source of randomness - or even Hyperledger fabric blockchain platform design, which altered the operation processing sequence - execution first, then ordering and final validation phase.</p><p  class='text-p'>We continue to research possible approaches to embedding the support for non-deterministic execution in the Orbs platform.</p><h3 id="randomness"  class='title-h3'
    >Randomness</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The Orbs research team is working on completing a paper on the topic of generating randomness.</p><p  class='text-p'>Apps that require randomness stand in front of a dilemma. If they become transparent, they lose their ability to generate randomness easily. If they remain obscure, users don&#39;t have a good reason to trust the app (other than reputation, that can&#39;t be based on much). Since the randomness can have great economic implications (by determining the winners of valuable prizes), it could be very profitable to tweak the randomness, predict it, or block its publication. How does an app guarantee (not promise!) the integrity of the randomness generation process it uses?</p><p  class='text-p'>Our paper introduces a randomness generation service in a game-theoretic environment that an app can use. Intuitively, it can be seen as a “randomness-as-a-service” type solution.  Randomness is produced on-demand (rather than as a beacon), instantly (without inherent delay built in), and counters collusion.</p><p  class='text-p'>A reliable randomness generation process might be useful for the Orbs network one day -- selecting transactions fairly in high load periods, selecting committees fairly (among a large network of validators).</p><h2 id="-strong-going-on-tour-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'

<p  class='text-p'>At the start of 2022, we sought to define Orbs’ place in web3; this was dubbed Orbs 3.0. Orbs 3.0 is the overarching framework for the project.

    >PoS V3 Multi-chain Staking</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>For those unfamiliar, the Orbs protocol is decentralized and executed by a public network of permissionless validators (dubbed &quot;Guardians&quot;) using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. The Orbs protocol relies on the ORBS token, which provides a system of incentives used to elect Guardians in a secure and decentralized manner.</p><p  class='text-p'>In response to community feedback to mitigate gas spikes, in 2022 we launched <a href="https://www.orbs.com/polygon-staking/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>multi-chain staking</a> on Ethereum and Polygon, dubbed PoS V3. The upgrade allowed the Orbs network to utilize the available blockchain stack to its fullest potential, the security of Ethereum as the base layer, and the scalability &amp; low fees of Polygon as a layer 2.</p><p  class='text-p'>After a year of multi-chain staking being live, there are <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x614389eaae0a6821dc49062d56bda3d9d45fa2ff?a=0xeeae6791f684117b7028b48cb5dd21186df80b9c#tokenAnalytics" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>191 million</a> ORBS staked at the time of writing on Polygon with an additional <a href="https://analytics.orbs.network/ethereum/overview/stake" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>775 million</a> ORBS staked on Ethereum.

    >Orbs as a Layer-3 blockchain</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>At the start of the year, we <a href="https://www.orbs.com/How-Orbs-Hybrid-Architecture-Is-Becoming-a-Game-Changer-in-DeFi/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>explained</a> to the community what Orbs as a layer 3 protocol meant and defined the goal of positioning Orbs onto the existing blockchain stack; and to have a fully functioning use case by the end of 2022.  </p><p  class='text-p'>Since then, we’ve developed Orbs’ two main L3 execution services: <a href="https://www.orbs.com/Deep-Dive-to-Orbs-Lambda/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs Lambda</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.orbs.com/Deep-Dive-to-Orbs-VM/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs VM</a>. Orbs Lambda functions as a decentralized serverless cloud and Orbs VM as a Docker-based decentralized virtual machine.

<p  class='text-p'>Lastly, Orbs has further solidified its position as blockchain-agnostic by integrating with the <a href="https://ton.org/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>TON blockchain</a>, the first non-EVM chain the Orbs project is building on. For a brief history lesson, the Durov brothers, the founders of Telegram, released a whitepaper for a blockchain in 2018 and began working on it until 2020 when it was forced to shut down operations by the SEC. However, since it was all open-sourced, a group of enthusiasts continued the project and are now being integrated with Telegram in modern-day 2022.</p><p  class='text-p'>TON has the potential to onboard Telegram’s <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/telegram-statistics/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>500M+</a> monthly active users onto the Blockchain. The approach to integrating Orbs and TON has been to build out core infrastructure components of the network, consult on best practices for L1s, and assist across all aspects of the project when necessary. Orbs recently released <a href="https://www.orbs.com/Announcing-TON-Minter-by-Orbs" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>TON Minter</a>, which became the official way to deploy Jettons on the TON chain (Similar to ERC-20 tokens). Despite launching at the beginning of the month, the tool has already seen significant usage, with 4,300 developers mining more than 470+ tokens. Additionally, Orbs released <a href="https://tonverifier.live/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>TON verifier</a> at the end of the year, which verifies the source code of TON contracts powered by Orbs L3.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/Orbs-in-2022-Driving-Forces-of-Adoption/image4.jpg" alt="TONVerifier"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs team has attended meetups, hackathons, and more in an effort to build a close relationship with the foundation. Tal Kol, Orbs CTO, has become a TON ambassador, showcasing the close ties between Orbs and the foundation. Our goal for Orbs on TON is as the network is further developed, Orbs will be positioned to become a major player in the ecosystem to power decentralized applications. This has huge potential for bringing usage to Orbs, especially if TON can onboard the next generation of users into web3 this coming year.</p><div class='line-separator'> </div>

<p  class='text-p'>In summary, this past year has been a period of significant building and development growth for the Orbs ecosystem. The project has not only achieved all of the goals for this year but also surpassed them in some areas. The entire Orbs community can look forward to continuing the web3 philosophy and establishing Orbs as a major layer-3 throughout the entire blockchain ecosystem in 2023. If you’re in the area, be sure to meet during the Orbs team’s conference attendance in Austin Texas, Korea, Japan, and elsewhere in 2023. </p></div></div></div><div class="blog-element" data-url="../announcing-support-for-ton-connect-2.0-in-minter-and-verifier" data-image="../assets/img/blog/announcing-support-for-ton-connect-2.0-in-minter-and-verifier/bg.jpeg" data-title="Announcing support for TON Connect 2.0 in Minter and Verifier" data-prefix="On" data-date="Dec 29, 2022"><div class="single-blog-header header"><h1 class="single-blog-header-title">Announcing support for TON Connect 2.0 in Minter and Verifier</h1><div class="single-blog-header-author-flex"><div class="single-blog-header-author flex-start"><section class="blog-author-details flex-start"><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/team/members/small/shahar.jpg" alt="Shahar Yakir"></figure>

After months of hard work, the TON community has finally <a href="https://telegra.ph/TON-Connect-20-12-26" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>released TON Connect 2.0</a> (TC2), a major step forward in improving the entire ecosystem.</p><p  class='text-p'>Contributors have followed the protocol standard and have upgraded both TON Minter &amp; TON Verifier to support TON Connect 2.0.</p><h3 id="what-is-ton-connect-and-why-is-it-important-"  class='title-h3'
    >What is TON connect and why is it important?</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In simple terms, TON Connect does the heavy lifting for dApp developers by publishing the list of supporting wallets and their connection details. This allows the dApp developer to create a dynamic list of wallets, each of which works with the same connection and transaction-sending API. This enables the dApp developer to focus on building the app and minimizing wallet-interaction logic to a minimum.</p><p  class='text-p'>From a user perspective, any TON Connect 2.0 compatible wallet can interact with any TON Connect 2.0 compatible dApp. dApps will now be able to retrieve the user&#39;s wallet address and send transactions from the application to the wallet for approval. This will make everything from connecting to usage seamless.</p><p  class='text-p'>Further, TON Connect 2.0 is an entirely open-sourced protocol and allows 3rd party wallet developers to integrate without friction, eliminating walled gardens.</p><h3 id="ton-minter-and-ton-verifier-add-support-for-tc2"  class='title-h3'
    >TON Minter and TON Verifier add support for TC2</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>This announcement follows the release of <a href="https://www.orbs.com/Announcing-TON-Minter-by-Orbs/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>TON Minter</a> and <a href="https://www.orbs.com/Announcing-TON-Verifier-by-Orbs/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>TON Verifier</a>. Both tools are amongst the first to have adopted the TON Connect 2.0 standard, effectively adding the anticipated Tonkeeper support.</p><p  class='text-p'>Minter has already assisted developers in deploying over 450+ Jettons and was added to the TON Foundation&#39;s official domain, while Verifier already covers a large portion (estimated 80%) of the contracts on the TON chain.</p><p  class='text-p'>This means that both of these tools can now be used with Tonkeeper and future TON Connect 2.0 supported wallets. Tonkeeper is one of the most widely used wallets by TON community participants, and we expect usage of both verifier and minter to grow accordingly.</p><p  class='text-p'>We believe it is important that these foundational tools adopt TC2, being an open protocol that supports the decentralization of the ecosystem of TON. This is why we are proud to have been early testers and adoption partners for TC2 and are looking forward to seeing more tools and wallets adopt it in the future.</p></div></div></div></ul></div><div
